Thanks to the extraordinary quality of simulation, the game will allow you to experience the real atmosphere of the ​​GT3  championship, competing against official drivers, teams, cars and circuits reproduced in-game with the highest level of accuracy ever achieved.
Sprint, Endurance and Spa 24 Hours races will come to life with an incredible level of realism, in both single and multiplayer modes.
Assetto Corsa Competizione is born from KUNOS Simulazioni&#39;s long-term experience, and it takes full advantage of Unreal Engine 4 to ensure photorealistic weather conditions and graphics, night races, motion capture animations, reaching a new standard in terms of driving realism and immersion, thanks to its further improved tyre and aerodynamic models.
Designed to innovate, Assetto Corsa Competizione will be set to promote eSports, bringing players at the heart of the Blancpain GT Series and putting them behind the wheel of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens and many other prestigious GT racing cars, all reproduced with outstanding level of detail.
REALISTIC SIMULATION
Assetto Corsa Competizione is designed to faithfully recreate the performance and the driving experience of real Blancpain GT Series cars through a sophisticated mathematical model that accurately replicates tyre grip, aerodynamic impact, engine parameters, suspensions and electronics systems that determine vehicle balance, as well as the influence of mechanical damage on the car&#39;s drivability.
NEW-GENERATION GRAPHICS AND VISUAL EFFECTS
Unreal Engine 4 guarantees photorealistic rendering and an accurate representation of scenarios, car materials and weather conditions. Thanks to the multi-channel audio sampling of real GT cars, the game conveys captivating and immersive acoustic surroundings and realistic environmental effects.
CARE FOR DETAILS
Even the secondary details are faithfully reproduced to make you feel the thrill of being in the cockpit of a real racing car. Doors, windshield wipers, headlights, racing lights, racing equipment and control devices such as ABS, traction control, engine ignition and ECU mapping, are all under the driver’s management to assure the best performance and offer the player total control of the car.
THE MOST ACCURATE CIRCUITS
Thanks to Laserscan technology, every official circuit is recreated with the utmost accuracy: all curbs and details perfectly fit their real counterparts to grant a gaming experience as faithful to reality as possible.
ADVANCED MULTIPLAYER FUNCTIONALITY
A well-structured ranking system will evaluate individual performance and driving behaviour to reward the most virtuous drivers and promote fair play in online competitions. The matchmaking function makes sure that you can compete with opponents of similar skill level and easily find online races to join, while the leaderboards will allow you to compare single-lap performance with virtual pilots from around the world with the same car, circuit and weather conditions.
IMMERSIVE SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE
Career, Championship and Free Play modes offer a complete and customizable gaming experience, also thanks to the tutorials and progressive aid levels that allow you to tailor AI opponent difficulty and vehicle stability control to your abilities. The Special Events will allow you to gain a first-hand experience of the most noteworthy real-life Blancpain GT Series challenges.
HIGH-LEVEL HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY

MOTION CAPTURE FOR REALISTIC ANIMATIONS
Motion capture technology is used to create the animations of mechanics and drivers in an even more realistic fashion, and guarantee a high level of player engagement during races, pit stops and driver changes.
BLANCPAIN GT SERIES
Encouraged by the success of the Blancpain Endurance Series, which after its creation in 2011 quickly became the global reference for GT racing, world-renowned Swiss watch manufacturer Blancpain and the SRO Motorsports Group decided at the end of 2013 to extend their partnership to the Blancpain Sprint Series. From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing.
With both the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup now sharing the same driver categories and points system, the ten-round Blancpain GT Series season – comprising five sprint events and five endurance events – crowns the world’s most complete GT drivers.
A Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup event consists of two races of one hour each, while the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup races range from three-hour events through a 1000 km race to the season highlight of the Total 24 Hours of Spa, one of the world’s leading 24-hour races.","['Simulation', 'Sports', 'Racing']",['Kunos Simulazioni'],['505 Games'],12/09/2018,Everyone,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",3.0,74,1.0,3.76,4.0,21.0,0.0,21.0,431.0,112.0,164782.0,assetto-corsa-competizione,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Online multiplayer', 'Local Multiplayer', 'VR', 'Driving', 'night', 'challenge', 'cars', 'car', 'pack', 'balance']",1,0.29999999999999993,0.29999999999999993,942,0.5,0.0,Casual,0.25065645765790623,179.46084558823532,5.0,109.0,0.40073529411764697,272.0

A mysterious signal has been recorded coming from the red planet.
The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message.
You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties.
Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. 
Things are starting to fall apart.
You begin seeing and hearing things that aren’t there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness?
Experience true cosmic horror
With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror.

Plot</h3>
The game follows an archeologist named Lemeza Kosugi. He continues the research of the lost city of La-Mulana that was started by his father Shorn. La-Mulana is a magical place that the protagonist believes was the source of all human civilizations. Its architecture consists of a mixture of various ancient cultures, such as Greek, Egyptian or Maya. Lemeza discovers that all human civilizations were created by an alien Mother with a goal to help it return to space.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls Lemeza in a 2D environment. The main character has to explore the levels that consist of many mazes, platforms, and environmental puzzles. The levels are non-linear, and the player can complete the game in a variety of ways, although there are no alternate endings. Lemeza can use his whip to fight enemies or to break some parts of the environment to clear the way.
Style</h3>
The game intentionally imitates the retro style of 16-bit console games from the 90s. It uses a limited color palette and pixelated visuals. La-Mulana is also obviously inspired by the Indiana Jones film series. The main character wears a fedora, fights with a whip and is very similar to Indiana. The game is set to the music typically associated with old adventure films.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie', 'Platformer']",['NIGORO'],"['AGM PLAYISM', 'NIS America', 'Active Gaming Media', 'EnjoyUp Games']",12/07/2012,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",3.0,80,0.0,3.41,4.0,59.0,0.0,59.0,359.0,101.0,133895.0,la-mulana,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', '2D', 'Difficult', 'Classic', 'Exploration', 'Controller', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'Action-Adventure', 'controller support', 'Side Scroller', 'overlay', 'Metroidvania', 'Remake', 'Puzzle-Platformer', 'Ninja']",0,0.0,0.4,3195,0.4,0.0,,0.36875,56.30252100840337,7.0,96.0,0.2689075630252101,357.0

Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.You won’t believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.A classic experience: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.Explore at your own pace: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings. A colossal adventure: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.New horrors, new weapons: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.Widescreen support: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.The question we’ve asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruinsGather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruinsDive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progressA detailed and beautifully dot-rendered worldSeven main weapons and over ten sub-weaponsOver 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruinsOver 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurer’s tablet, the ""Mobile Super X3""Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the gameLumisa Kosugi(21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist)Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child.

His love of exploration has not faded, however, and he still finds time to go spelunking in secret.Shawn Kosugi(67 years old)After revealing the ""Treasure of All Life"" he brought back from the ruins of La-Mulana, he returned to a hermetic life once more.

It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.
Setting</h3>
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.
Gameplay</h3>
Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map.

Townsmen - A Kingdom Rebuilt,159.9,95.94,79.95,159.9,95.94,79.95,Townsmen - A Kingdom Rebuilt,"Welcome, your Highness! A vast land awaits your settlers and is ready to be colonized. Send your architects and builders to plan and construct a city. But also send your craftsmen, to cut some wood and to mine ore. Make sure your fields are on fertile grounds, to get all the food for your hungry subjects! Townsmen – A Kingdom Rebuilt hands the crown to you: Guide your people from their first steps in a small village to a massive medieval metropolis with thousands of inhabitants.
Overcome the challenges that lie ahead. Your citizens have various needs in order to stay happy. And you have to keep them happy, to keep the tax coins rolling which you need to build even more. Beware, as there are many things in the world that will disturb the happiness: Seasons will change the demand for certain goods – more water is needed during summer, more clothes in winter. Catastrophes may hit your prospering city, the plague, a large fire or an avalanche won’t make anyone happy nor will a bandit attack!
A huge variety of houses to build and many different jobs for your subjects will keep you busy. The armory will produce weapons for your soldiers, to keep your citizens save from bandits. The bakery or the butcher’s workshop will provide food, the monastery, the juice manufacture and the vineyard will bring the drinks – and everything can be bought at the marketplace! Make sure to have an eye on the daily routines of your people – besides jobs &amp; food, they also need a place for recreation like a park, houses to live and entertainment in the jousting grounds or the tavern!
Each of your deeds is meaningful: If you order your folks to build a house, if you send them to a new job – everything will reward you with experience points. This progression system will allow you to research techniques that for example increase the amount of taxes you get or make your watchtowers more efficient. In every map you play!

Carrying out their orders are THE HORSEMEN, Nephilim (powerful beings spawned from the unnatural union of angels and demons) who have pledged themselves to the Council and been granted immense power.  However, this power came at a tragic cost: the Horsemen were ordered to use their newfound strength to wipe out the rest of their kind.  What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim.
Still reeling from the events on Eden, WAR and STRIFE have been given a new assignment -- LUCIFER, the enigmatic and deceptive demon king, has been plotting to upset the Balance by granting power to master demons throughout Hell.

We pitch this as ""Goldeneye 007"" meets ""Metal Gear Solid"" in an immersive VR world. 

The prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics.

With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. 

Players assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their ""Espire Control Theatre"" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The ""Control Theatre"" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.

Plot</h3>
Shenmue III continues the story of the protagonist of the previous games: Ryo Hazuki, a young Japanese martial artist from the city of Yokosuka. His goal is to avenge the death of his father. Hazuki follows the murderer, Lan Di, to the mountainous region in China called Guilin. A young Chinese girl named Ling Shenhua, who shares a mysterious spiritual bond with Ryo, accompanies him on his quest. There&#39;s a prophecy that their destinies are intertwined. 
Ryo and Ling walk through various Chinese villages, temples, and fortresses, fighting enemies on their way. They face not only Lan Di but also a new villain named Niao Sun. While the game is set outside Japan, Hazuki can stay in touch with his friends back home by calling them on the phone.
Development</h3>
The game spent more than ten years in development due to high costs of the original two games (the first Shenmue was the most expensive game ever at the time of its release). Shenmue III only came to be made because of a crowdfunding campaign. This is not the final part of the story, according to the series&#39; creator Yu Suzuki, who is planning more Shenmue games.","['Action', 'Adventure']","['Deep Silver', 'Ys Net']","['Sony Computer Entertainment', 'Deep Silver']",19/11/2019,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",2.0,68,2.0,2.89,3.0,44.0,2177.0,47.0,236.0,101.0,315541.0,shenmue-iii,['Singleplayer'],0,0.8000266675555852,0.8000266675555852,509,0.8000266675555852,0.0,,0.5558437708441414,252.01513966480445,8.0,103.0,0.2877094972067039,358.0

The Outer Worlds,299.9,119.96,119.96,299.9,119.96,119.96,The Outer Worlds,"The Outer Worlds is a new single-player first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division.
In The Outer Worlds, you awake from hibernation on a colonist ship that was lost in transit to Halcyon, the furthest colony from Earth located at the edge of the galaxy, only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy it. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.
Key Features
The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.
You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren&#39;t particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.
Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It&#39;s up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure', 'RPG']",['Obsidian Entertainment'],['Private Division'],25/10/2019,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",5.0,80,1.0,3.95,4.0,860.0,0.0,887.0,432.0,101.0,336406.0,the-outer-worlds,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Action RPG', 'Space', 'role-playing', 'Choices Matter']",0,0.6,0.6,534,0.6,0.0,,0.3522160291962763,235.57807262569833,15.0,218.0,0.6089385474860336,358.0

Contraptions,53.9,16.17,13.47,53.9,16.17,13.47,Contraptions,"Contraptions is a physics based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look which is a spiritual successor to the very warmly received MechanicMaster for the Nintendo DS, which was published by Midway Games.How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for ""Contraptions"" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.FeaturesSolve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worldsCreate an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat itUse a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegsComplete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like</ul>GameplayOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.GadgetsSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. ObjectivesThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","['Action', 'Indie', 'Puzzle']","['Moragam, Co']",['Funbox Media'],09/10/2019,Everyone,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Nintendo']",0.0,Without info,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,264.0,0.0,0.0,contraptions,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Funny', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Physics']",0,0.7,0.7500927643784786,550,0.7,0.0,,0.273711690339325,46.2949014084507,4.0,183.0,0.5154929577464789,355.0

The genre itself is well-established already with giants like Diablo series, but Torchlight offers the fresh experience for veterans and newbies alike.
  The steampunk fantasy world lets players enjoy the lush grass of various beautiful environments, the glowing caves filled with mushrooms, and the endless deserts with their treasures! Lots of different enemies always try their best to stop our adventurers from their goal. From every corner there comes danger, only briefly allowing the players to collect their thoughts and dive yet again in battle with evil.
  Following Torchlight, the second game starts with chaos erupting from underneath the world. A crazed former hero now takes the lead of hordes of different creatures, and in defeating him and his minions lies the ultimate goal of our new heroes. Take on the mantle of one of the four available classes, and be sure to utilize their might at its fullest. Stay flexible, for the treasure is always surprising, and don’t forget to use your trusty companion as the aid in battle, or as a heavy-packed war mule. Be ready for harsh defeats, or, if you feel like immortal, try the hardest difficulty for the ultimate roguelike challenge.

Setting</h3>
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which a nuclear war annihilated all humanity. Many years later, Earth is inhabited by the mutated creatures that look like combinations of humans with other animals and things. There&#39;s The Ark, a neon-lit sinkhole that serves as the hub for the player characters. This is where they can buy ammunition and armor, meet other characters and accept quests. Then there&#39;s the Zone, a largely unexplored dangerous world where Mutants roam. Somewhere in the Zone lies the legendary Eden, a safe haven where they can find all the answers they seek.
Characters</h3>
The game has three main protagonists. First, there&#39;s Dux, the duck-headed wise-cracking mutant with an attitude. Then there&#39;s Bormin, a huge gruff pig that has anger issues. Their third companion is Selma, a seemingly human female who has protective stone skin. Each of the characters specializes in using certain weapons and has a set of special mutant abilities.
Gameplay</h3>
Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden combines real-time exploration and stealth system with square grid-bound tactical turn-based combat in the vein of X-Com series. The player controls the three characters as a party, switching between them when needed.","['Adventure', 'RPG', 'Strategy']","['Funcom Oslo A/S', 'The Bearded Ladies', 'The Bearded Ladies Consulting']",['Funcom'],03/12/2018,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",4.0,78,0.0,3.72,4.0,359.0,0.0,364.0,474.0,101.0,81659.0,mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden,"['Singleplayer', 'RPG', 'Horror', 'Turn-Based', 'Turn-Based Combat']",0,0.6,0.6,860,0.6,0.0,,0.6000000000000001,162.95999999999995,6.0,76.0,0.21348314606741572,356.0

- A total of three playable characters, two of which have yet to be revealed...
- Literally a metric ton of weapons and spells, which you can upgrade, level up and visually customize.
- Beautiful 2.5D graphics: 3D models crafted with a lot of love and care on a 2D game environment. That means lots of cool tricks that regular 2D can&#39;t do...
WHEN?
We&#39;re going to be revealing the release window of the game very soon.

Starting with nothing, but simple clothes, flair, and a rug, players will have to scavenge for items, transport, and weapons, while running away from either zeds, bandits or hostile players.
DayZ can be played as a single player game, but most of the current player base is using multiplayer servers in order to form groups, clans and survive together.  In order to make the survival aspect more realistic, aside from thirst and hunger, several diseases have been added to the game, with specific cures for each effect.

Fade to Silence,149.5,49.33,49.33,149.5,49.33,49.33,Fade to Silence,"As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive.
In order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons.
“You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today.
The wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?”
Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.
“You’re out hunting. The barren, snow-filled landscape is endless and unrelenting. A Ripper comes out of nowhere, and you fight it off, narrowly dodging its gigantic claws.
Then you see it: a distant fire. Another person? Impossible. But there’s a strange noise—a voice?  Wild hope sears your heart; you won’t be alone anymore. The voice in your head steps in, discouraging you from investigating. “Anyone living must have done terrible things to survive”, it says. You quiet the voice, defying it this time, and move in closer. Another person could help you rebuild, gather food, harvest deer. You see someone—yes! Someone else is out here. Then, you hear a scream. But you hesitate. How can you trust them? Another scream, desperate. There’s only one way to find out.”Features:Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area.
Wolf Sled Expeditions: Pack your sled, take a follower with you and engage in long term expeditions into the farthest regions.
Fight System: Tiered weapon system, melee and ranged combat.

Plot</h3>
Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth&#39;s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series&#39; canon). 
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.","['Action', 'Shooter']",['4A Games'],['Deep Silver'],13/02/2019,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",11.0,81,5.0,4.07,4.0,887.0,1434.0,901.0,631.0,100.0,610547.0,metro-exodus,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Exploration', 'Stealth', 'Violent', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'Survival Horror', 'Cinematic', 'Crafting', 'steam', 'category', 'meat', 'russia']",0,0.7,0.7,788,0.7,0.0,,0.5797604608853851,133.7486235955056,9.0,116.0,0.3258426966292135,356.0

RESIDENT EVIL 2,199.5,79.8,79.8,199.5,79.8,79.8,Resident Evil 2,"Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. 
Plot</h3>
The plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists&#39; storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character&#39;s POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.
Changes from the original</h3>
Besides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player&#39;s character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There&#39;s also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure']",['Capcom'],['Capcom'],25/01/2019,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",11.0,91,22.0,4.48,5.0,1275.0,7712.0,1293.0,549.0,108.0,1000000.0,resident-evil-2-2019,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Full controller support', 'Story Rich', 'Third Person', 'Horror', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Violent', 'Zombies', 'Dark', 'Action-Adventure', 'Survival Horror', 'Remake', '3rd-Person Perspective', 'Blood', 'first person mod', 'Psychological']",0,0.6000000000000001,0.6000000000000001,807,0.6000000000000001,0.0,,0.33152789380859554,159.59441340782126,12.0,216.0,0.6033519553072627,358.0

Premise and setting</h3>
The series is set in the Strangereal, a fictional alternate version of Earth. This world has different geography and history, albeit its countries and cultures are based on prototypes from our real world. Skies Unknown follows the Lighthouse War (also called the Second Continental War) a conflict between the Kingdom of Erusea and the Osean Federation in an alternate 2019. The goal of the war is to control the International Space Elevator. The Erusean army attacks the Osean military that protected the Elevator. In response, Osea launches a large-scale attack against Farbanti, Erusea&#39;s capital city, causing massive loss of civilian lives.
Main characters</h3>
The main protagonist in the Skies Unknown story campaign is Trigger, a pilot in the Osean Air Force. He was framed for murder and transferred to the penal squadron. While the player starts as an Osean military, the game does not favor any side in the conflict. Rosa Cossette D&#39;Elise, a princess and heir to the throne of Erusea, also plays a major role in the plot.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls Trigger&#39;s fighter plane, F-22A Raptor, and completes various missions against enemy fighter jets. Other types of aircraft do not appear in this game, unlike in the previous games. The game reintroduces some of the mechanics from the previous installments, such as checkpoints and player-controlled flares. Skies Unknown is also the first game in the series to make clouds influence the gameplay.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Simulation', 'Arcade']","['BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America', 'Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'Project Aces']","['Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US']",18/01/2019,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",5.0,79,12.0,4.02,4.0,163.0,6946.0,167.0,484.0,0.0,293830.0,ace-combat-7,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', 'First-Person', 'Exploration', 'Online multiplayer', 'Action-Adventure', 'Cinematic', 'VR', 'Realistic', '3rd-Person Perspective', 'Flight', 'flying', 'jet', 'flight-simulator', 'flying-simulator']",1,0.7500200080032013,0.7500200080032013,814,0.7500200080032013,0.0,,0.6701037666975187,188.6231284916201,9.0,131.0,0.3659217877094973,358.0

Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people).

Plot</h3>
The game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury&#39;s mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he&#39;s obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG']","['THQ Nordic', 'Gunfire Games']",['THQ Nordic'],27/11/2018,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",5.0,68,4.0,3.39,4.0,367.0,2569.0,373.0,391.0,100.0,416277.0,darksiders-iii,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'Third Person', 'Gore', 'Female Protagonist', 'Violent', 'Action-Adventure', 'Hack and Slash', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'Dark Fantasy']",0,0.7700233411137045,0.8200400133377792,866,0.7700233411137045,0.0,,0.42547120970147934,218.1794101123596,12.0,228.0,0.6404494382022473,356.0

It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.
Setting</h3>
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.
Gameplay</h3>
Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map.

Named after a real-world phenomenon where players’ brains are so engrossed that images of the iconic falling Tetrimino blocks (i.e. the Tetris playing pieces) linger in their vision, thoughts, and even dreams, TETRIS EFFECT amplifies this magical feeling of total immersion by surrounding you with fantastic, fully three-dimensional worlds that react and evolve based on how you play. Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetris pieces themselves, pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you’re playing.

SOULCALIBUR VI,249.9,37.48,37.48,249.9,37.48,37.48,SoulCalibur VI,"Soulcalibur VI is the seventh major installment in its series of 3D sword fighting games. This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.
Plot</h3>
The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.
Gameplay</h3>
The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There&#39;s also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.
Characters</h3>
The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.","['Action', 'Fighting']","['BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America', 'Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'NAMCO']","['Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US']",19/10/2018,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",2.0,83,0.0,3.77,4.0,151.0,0.0,151.0,664.0,100.0,748542.0,soulcalibur-vi,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Steam Cloud', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Fantasy', 'Split Screen', 'Online multiplayer', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Character Customization', ""Beat 'em up""]",1,0.8500200080032013,0.8500200080032013,905,0.8500200080032013,0.0,,0.760845027666239,172.88994413407826,11.0,145.0,0.40502793296089373,358.0

It’s going to be different, because it’s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let’s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other’s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That’s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.
What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities – she can run fast, he can sneak – but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there’s nothing in the world that can stop you.

Throughout secret missions, classified files investigations and enemy agent interrogations, peel off layers upon layers of a sinister plot and save the world from a somber future. If you can.Features
A rich alternate history plot anchored by historical events and characters, bringing the chillingly relevant Cold War reality to life from a unique point of view.
Next-generation turn-based combat: Unprecedented flexibility of movement and actions, variable overwatch modes and assault-oriented Breaching ability
Expanded battlefield: position assets around the world and call for assistance in the middle of battle when you need it most. Just remember, the enemy can bring their own reinforcements, heavy weapons or even air support and their toy box is much bigger than yours.
Knowing is half the battle: scout mission locations ahead of time, infiltrate with undercover operatives and improve your odds. Elite enemy agents with their own agenda are always ready to spring their own ambushes.
Go loud or go home (stealthily): fully-fledged stealth gameplay with silenced weapons, silent takedowns and cutting-edge Cold War era security technology. All this makes completing entire operations clandestinely a viable option.
Run your own counterintelligence organization: recruit subjects of top secret government experiments, operatives of the world’s secret services, KGB &amp; CIA included, or even criminals. Manage a global operation, securing weapons, resources and contacts. Command from a distance or go hands-on to fight for the real stakes.
Actively pursue the truth: research cases, locations and individuals in Investigation Board gameplay mechanics to uncover new missions, resources and technologies.
Employ technology ruthlessly to your advantage: learn from the enemy or research your own methods for brainwashing, interrogation, body engineering and chemical enhancement.
Customize your operatives and then do it again once they need a new identity: forge documents, change appearance, retrain them for lethal effect and send them back into the fray.
Replayable, modular campaign with an array of mechanics to ensure unique and markedly different playthroughs: generated character names and backgrounds, modular and algorithmically populated maps, randomized intelligence snippets.
A highly replayable, story-driven campaign with meticulously designed and adaptable maps.
Two stories to choose from: a KGB counterintelligence operative or a CIA wet work commando who have to come to grips with the truth and challenge the conspiracy, with an additional New Game Plus protagonist.
No mission too big, no mission too small: enter a bustling government facility undercover to assassinate a target with surgical precision or mount a heavy frontal assault on an enemy staging base. With optional objectives closely linked to a mission’s complexity and opportunities like loot and intelligence to collect, there are decisions to be made at each step.","['Action', 'RPG', 'Strategy']","['Gambitious', 'CreativeForge Games', 'Creative Forge Games']","['Forever Entertainment', 'Good Shepherd Entertainment']",13/08/2018,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",4.0,71,0.0,3.29,4.0,68.0,0.0,68.0,246.0,104.0,26153.0,phantom-doctrine,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'Online multiplayer', 'Violent', 'role-playing']",1,0.8,0.8,972,0.808189855746859,0.0,,0.37440531173819136,169.4719101123596,7.0,201.0,0.5646067415730337,356.0

Overwatch: Legendary Edition,229.99,75.89,75.89,229.99,75.89,75.89,Overwatch,"The Legacy</h3>
Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.
The story and setting</h3>
Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.
Continuous support</h3>
The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Casual', 'Massively Multiplayer']",[],"['Activision Blizzard', 'Blizzard Entertainment']",24/05/2016,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",41.0,91,1.0,4.24,5.0,739.0,9994.0,757.0,562.0,100.0,1000000.0,overwatch,"['Multiplayer', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', '3D', 'online', 'hero', 'Team']",0,0.6700291317013783,0.6700291317013783,1783,0.6700291317013783,0.0,,0.6700291317013783,191.24977653631282,8.0,90.0,0.25139664804469275,358.0

God of War Digital Deluxe Edition,119.9,80.33,80.33,119.9,79.13,79.13,God of War,"It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. 
His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. 
Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. 
From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. 
With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling.

In the gameplay, the primary focus is made on destroying numerous monsters and developing character characteristics and skills. The plot is directly divided into three acts, and the game world, respectively, into three broad areas: Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt and the Ancient East, as well as the final location - Olympus.
One of the features of the gameplay is the presence of many elements, borrowings and references to lands, characters, weapons and monsters from the ancient mythologies of the Greeks and Egyptians, and the plot bosses are the murderer of Hercules - Nessus, the huge scarab and demonic bull.","['Action', 'RPG']","['THQ Nordic', 'Handy Games', 'Iron Lore Entertainment']","['THQ Nordic', 'THQ', 'Nordic Games', 'DotEmu']",26/06/2006,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Android', 'Nintendo']",1.0,69,0.0,3.9,4.0,396.0,0.0,397.0,531.0,101.0,1000000.0,titan-quest,"['Multiplayer', 'role-playing', 'Top-Down', 'ancient-greece', 'hack-n-slash']",0,0.6500334448160535,0.6500334448160535,5403,0.791170568561873,0.0,,0.4885063749616626,102.65333333333332,15.0,229.0,0.6414565826330532,357.0

SYMMETRY is a micro-management survival game set in a retro- futuristic, sci-fi universe. Your main goal is to manage the crash survivors and help them withstand the desolate, extremely cold environment in order to fix their spacecraft and escape. The non- obvious plot is accompanied by an atmospheric musical score and graphic design that sustains the harsh and mysterious ambience.
Survivors’ life functions crucial to their existence, such as eating, resting and mental health need to be taken care of. Extreme circumstances may force crew members to develop new skills like botanics or power plant operations, that weren&#39;t necessary in their Earthly life. Gathering all the parts required to repair the spaceship becomes a race against time, as extreme weather conditions and life-threatening supernatural activities become more and more present.
Vector graphics give the game a feeling of mystery and severity of the deserted world. Using dimmed and pastel colors throughout the scenery creates a sense of remoteness from reality and builds an unreal atmosphere of the landscape.

Gameplay</h3>
Like the previous games of the series, no story mode is present in Gran Turismo Sport. Three modes are available to the players: Sports, Arcade, and Campaign. The game focuses on providing the most realistic racing experience possible.
Sports mode allows the players to compete with each other online. Polyphony Digital puts a heavy emphasis on the addition of the official FIA Championships set of rules. The players are offered a wide range of events, competitions, and tournaments to participate in. The Sports mode is region locked in order to provide the best experience with as less network lag possible.
In Arcade mode, the players participate in events they choose on whichever vehicle available in the game against AI opponents. Usual races, Time trials, Drift trials, and two-player split-screen game modes are available to the players.
The game&#39;s Campaign mode is a classic GT experience. The players have to obtain licenses, buy used cars at first and participate in small championships on their way to the best racing leagues of the world.
Gran Turismo Sport features 177 vehicles for the players to use. The game has vehicles from all their history, starting with the first car ever produced, Ford Model T. Gran Turismo&#39;s driving simulation is pronounced by the general public to be the most realistic one to ever be in a racing simulator genre.","['Simulation', 'Racing']",['Polyphony Digital'],['Sony Computer Entertainment'],17/10/2017,Everyone,['PlayStation'],0.0,75,7.0,3.95,4.0,448.0,0.0,449.0,382.0,102.0,1000000.0,gran-turismo-sport,"['exclusive', 'true exclusive', 'Driving']",0,0.5000625078134766,0.5000625078134766,1272,0.5000625078134766,0.0,,0.4543250833183416,71.61921348314604,7.0,82.0,0.2303370786516854,356.0
ARK: Survival Evolved Explorer’s Edition,373.9,93.47,93.47,373.9,93.47,74.78,ARK: Survival Evolved,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!
Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!
You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!
By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.
Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!
By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.
Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!
All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new Engrams to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D Explorer Notes. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!
Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!
The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.
On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.
You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!

Three years have passed since Count Uria´s plots. The Vanquishers of the Nine Hordes long parted ways but life in Aventuria went on. Cassia, a young woman of noble descent, has only one goal: She wants to claim the Shark Throne, no matter the price; and be it only for one day. Unfortunately, there are two problems that potentially foil her plans. First of all, she spends her days incarcerated in a dungeon and secondly, there is already a man on her throne: Marwan. She is neither fond nor proficient in matters of diplomacy or politics, so she chooses a more... practical approach. She intends to break out of prison and overthrow Marwan to claim the throne herself. For this, she needs strong allies. She needs to recruit an army of Sellswords and rally the Vanquishers of the Nine Hordes around her. Sounds like a solid plan, doesn&#39;t it? But then again, how cunning must one be to escape the dungeon&#39;s walls; and how reckless must one be to gather and command the worst scum of the realms?

Plot</h3>
There are two plots in the game, developing at different points in time.
The first story is about a father who avenges the Empire for his son. His son, a bomber pilot, was executed by the Empire because he refused to drop a nuclear bomb during the Enkies attack.
The second story is about the last survivors of the Enkie race, who also plan to take revenge on the Empire for the fact that the Empire destroyed them.
Both plots of the game often develop in the same locations, but the differences between the situation in these places are very significant, because the events of different plots occur at completely different times.
Everything happens on the planet Seol, which is very hike to Earth. However, the crust of this planet is very unstable, and this is the cause of the constant earthquakes. The landscape of the planet is very variable, its geography changes significantly over very short periods of time.
By the time the game starts on the planet, two main factions compete: the aggressive Empire, ruled by the dictator, and the kingdom of Atarak, inhabited by the Enkie race.
The Enkie race follows the teachings of the great prophet Enkie and is able to manage time. They can carry themselves and any object at any time past or future.
The empire does not know how to manage time, but it is developing a machine that can do it. This machine will be able to accelerate the individual time of any object or living being, in order to bring it to the end of its existence, erasing, as soon as possible.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls the aircraft, the main weapon of which can be upgraded. The main weapon can be used without limitation. There is also a secondary weapon. It is more powerful, but its use is limited.
The player&#39;s performance is estimated by the sum of the indicators: the destruction of enemies, the damage received, collected powerups (shielding, extra time, and upgraded weapon).
Destruction of enemies with the primary weapon will increase the game&#39;s score multiplier, while use of the secondary weapon or time manipulation will reset the multiplier.
The game has four difficulties: normal, challenging, hard and insane.

Instead of health, a player’s state is measured by time. At the beginning of each level, the player receives a certain amount of time. This time can be reduced (accelerated) due to the actions of enemies, and the destruction of enemies, on the contrary, increases, stretches time.","['Action', 'Shooter']","['THQ Nordic', 'Grasshopper Manufacture', 'Digital Reality', 'Gyroscope Games']",['THQ Nordic'],07/08/2017,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",3.0,82,0.0,3.26,4.0,50.0,0.0,50.0,615.0,0.0,18148.0,sine-mora-ex,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'First-Person', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Local Co-Op', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Side Scroller', ""Shoot 'Em Up"", 'Bullet Hell']",0,0.7,0.8,1343,0.8,0.0,,0.7083437630371298,65.59185393258427,7.0,90.0,0.2528089887640449,356.0

ARK: Survival Evolved,207.9,41.58,41.58,207.9,41.58,41.58,ARK: Survival Evolved,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!
Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!
You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!
By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.
Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!
By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.
Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!
All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new Engrams to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D Explorer Notes. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!
Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!
The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.
On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.
You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!

It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’.
DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.
With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3.
Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents.

Plot</h3>
An unnamed journalist investigates the Mishima family history after his family got killed in a war that was started by Jin Kazama. In his investigation, the journalist tries to find out why did Jin&#39;s grandfather kill his own wife and threw his son Kazuya down the cliff. At the same time, Jin goes into hiding after defeating an ancient demon named Azazel while his grandfather takes over Mishima Zaibatsu. The world war goes on.
Gameplay</h3>
Just like the previous games in the series (apart from Tekken Tag Tournament 1 &amp; 2), Tekken 7&#39;s gameplay revolves around one-on-one hand-to-hand fights. 
Players are free to choose one of 43 playable characters. Every character has their own personal list of attacks and combos and drastically differs in play style.
Several new additions were made to the game&#39;s combat system. Players can now use devastating hits that will take from 40 to 80 percent of the enemy&#39;s health if the player&#39;s health drops too low. Moreover, the players are able to use a Rage Drive. It allows for performing a special hit on a high speed that inflicts major damage to the enemy. The last new addition is Power Crush. This feature lets the players attack their opponent even when they&#39;re under attack. Players can&#39;t block their enemies low kicks while using the Power Crush.","['Action', 'Sports', 'Fighting']","['BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America', 'Bandai Namco Entertainment']","['Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US']",18/03/2015,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",7.0,82,6.0,4.07,4.0,495.0,0.0,497.0,649.0,101.0,1000000.0,tekken-7,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'Story Rich', 'Third Person', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Difficult', 'Split Screen', 'Online multiplayer', 'Controller', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Anime', 'Nudity', 'Character Customization', 'Competitive', ""Beat 'em up"", 'Heist', 'e-sports']",1,0.8,0.8,2216,0.8,0.0,,0.8,154.00860335195534,9.0,116.0,0.3240223463687151,358.0

Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens.

Up to 6 players spawn on the map in order to kill the boss. The players have to hold out 4, 7 or 10 waves of enemies after which the boss spawns. Each wave has more enemies and special mutants. After the end of a wave, the players can visit the trader, where they can buy weaponry and equipment. Players earn money and experience points for killing enemies. The more players there are on the map - the more enemies spawn. The difficulty level is also affected by the number of players. The only difference between singleplayer and multiplayer is in the number of players.
The game features a class system. Players spawn with level 0 and can level themselves up to level 25. Each class is better in one field of combat.

The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die.

resident evil 4,149.99,59.99,59.99,149.99,59.99,59.99,Resident Evil 4,"Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.
Development began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.
Resident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the over-the-shoulder third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.
<h1>Gameplay</h1>
The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.
Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a finishing move on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.
The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (The Cattle in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.
The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is Separate Ways, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. Ada&#39;s Report, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames The Mercenaries and Assignment Ada (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.
<h1>Plot</h1>
U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.
While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a sample once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.
After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.
Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure']","['Capcom', 'Capcom U.S.A', 'Capcom Production Studio 4']","['Ubisoft Entertainment', 'Capcom', 'Nintendo', 'THQ', 'Nintendo Australia', 'Red Ant Enterprises']",11/01/2005,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Android', 'Nintendo']",5.0,83,22.0,4.39,5.0,1179.0,0.0,1187.0,480.0,0.0,1000000.0,resident-evil-4,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Sci-fi', 'Third Person', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Difficult', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Third-Person Shooter', 'Zombies', 'Captions available', 'Replay Value', 'Survival Horror', 'Remake', 'Quick-Time Events', 'Inventory Management', 'first person shooter', 'tank controls', 'survival-horror-game']",0,0.6000400026668444,0.6000400026668444,5934,0.6000400026668444,0.0,,0.6000400026668445,121.50260504201681,8.0,113.0,0.3165266106442577,357.0

The overall visual style of the game is inspired by various science fiction books. Demoscene also served as a source of inspiration for the developers.
The main feature that the game revolves around is the procedural generation. Each planet you visit is generated from scratch. The information about the planets and their inhabitants is dynamically updated so every player can discover a new species or planet and give it a name.
No Man&#39;s Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life, gathering resources, space battles, maintaining and upgrading the player&#39;s ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. 
On release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect.

DOOM,71.5,35.75,35.75,71.5,21.45,21.45,DOOM,"Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.
In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as Doomguy, fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as WADs. As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre&#39;s boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game&#39;s release, became known simply as Doom clones. Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.
The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game&#39;s source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast paced action of the first two games.","['Action', 'Shooter']","['id Software', 'Nerve Software']","['SEGA', 'Valve', 'Bethesda Softworks', 'Activision Blizzard', 'Atari', 'GT Interactive Software', 'Ocean Software', 'GT Interactive', 'WMS Industries', 'Williams Entertainment', 'Imagineer']",10/12/1993,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Linux', 'Nintendo', 'Atari', 'SEGA', '3DO']",0.0,Without info,6.0,4.38,5.0,511.0,0.0,515.0,425.0,0.0,1000000.0,doom-2,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'vr mod', 'violance']",0,0.5,0.5,9984,0.7,0.0,,0.6537735849056603,57.54239436619718,7.0,106.0,0.29859154929577464,355.0

Both versions of the character have their own reasons to hate the leader of evil forces, Shax. If a female character is selected, his sister is abducted by Shax as a result of a dispute over the jewelry that the player was selling. In the case of a man&#39;s game, the player refuses to sell the sword to Shax, resulting in Shax killing the character&#39;s wife.
Everything else in the game is the same for both female and male characters.

The great magician reveals to the character that the character was chosen to become the new Dragon - there have already been more than a dozen other Dragons before. The Dragon is given combat magic, the Dragon&#39;s task is to protect this world and rid it of lies, corruption and evil spirits.
Gameplay</h3>
The main character, male or female, accepts from the great magician Roth the name Dragon and the mission of improving the world. To achieve this, he follows a linear route, between checkpoints and fast travel locations known as Reliquaries. The hero is armed with magic - and it does not require replenishment of any resource, it always is, always works.
The enemies of the Dragon are diverse and contain a randomized loot, dropping out of them when defeated. The value of loot based on the rarity level of the character has been achieved through reaching checkpoints.
The magic of the hero, the power of his spells can be greatly increased if the hero performs specific tasks.
The main character helps another character, male or female. This character acts as a scout whose name is Gryphon.
After the end of the game, the player can continue to play the same character in order to strengthen the power of his spells - for this you should start a New Game Plus.

The Hero can have 3 Sigils applied at any given time. Sigils - Fire, Ice, Lightning, Corruption, and more - act as elemental schools of magic for the player to cast.
Sigils are unlocked as the player moves in the game.
You can switch between the Sigils you use at a Reliquary.
The level of each Sigil can be increased by achieving certain goals. The characteristics of magical spells can be improved and customized, by conscious manipulation and using the loot dropping out of enemies.

Plot</h3>
The events depicted in the game force the player to explore the world of Kholatsyakhl — Ural mountain, leaving no stone unturned to find the truth about the death of nine students on the Dyatlov Pass. The point of the game is to find all of the notes and progress through the plot, but collecting all the items is not necessary — it is nonetheless recommended to assemble them all to recollect the 1959 events. 
Gameplay</h3>
The game is mostly about exploring and uncovering the mystery behind the death of the hike participators. There are some jump-scares involved. The gameplay centers around walking and hiding from The Shadows of the dead students— the only hostile characters in the game. With the absence of jumping ability, the protagonist has quite a few exploring tricks at their disposal. The game is strictly linear giving, however, with the ability to replay the main plot, collecting every possible note.

Story</h3>
The game takes place between the events of Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III. The game features two story-oriented modes: Character Story and A Shadow Falls. In Character Story you can choose any character to go through a series of fights. It starts with a prologue and finishes with ending unique for each character. At launch only, Characters Story was available while A Shadow Falls, a full-fledged story mode that describes a battle between World Fighters and criminal syndicate Shandaloo was added later in July 2016.
Gameplay</h3>
Like its predecessors, Street Fighter is a 2D one-on-one fighting game. The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character. Using these moves helps to fill V-Gauge which can be used to perform V-Reversals, special counter-attacks, or V-Trigger especially powerful abilities that require the full gauge.","['Action', 'Fighting']","['Capcom', 'Capcom U.S.A']",['Capcom'],15/02/2016,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",6.0,74,12.0,3.55,4.0,336.0,0.0,341.0,593.0,100.0,1000000.0,street-fighter-v,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', '2D', 'Classic', 'Female Protagonist', 'Controller', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Anime', 'Nudity', 'Memes', 'Competitive', ""Beat 'em up"", '2.5D', '2D Fighter', 'e-sports']",0,0.6,0.6,1882,0.6,0.0,,0.6,61.136516853932584,7.0,86.0,0.2415730337078652,356.0

The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.
Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people&#39;s consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.
Her parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.
The CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.
The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same.","['Action', 'Adventure']",['Quantic Dream'],"['Sony Computer Entertainment', 'Quantic Dream']",08/10/2013,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",3.0,73,0.0,3.76,4.0,1204.0,0.0,1214.0,527.0,100.0,979065.0,beyond-two-souls,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'Story Rich', 'cooperative', 'Sci-fi', 'Third Person', 'Horror', 'Female Protagonist', 'Split Screen', 'Violent', 'Choices Matter', 'Cinematic', 'Drama', 'Quick-Time Events', 'Narration', 'Beautiful', 'Thriller', 'Dynamic Narration', 'Emotional', 'Remote Play on Tablet', 'Remote Play Together', 'Shared/Split Screen Co-op', 'Remote Play on Phone']",0,0.6000600060006,0.65006500650065,2742,0.8000800080008001,-1.4452445244524452,,0.3611765217769656,174.74436974789916,6.0,282.0,0.7899159663865547,357.0

The Xeodrifter flies his ship in deep space. Unexpectedly, his ship gets hit by an asteroid and he has to crash-land on a nearby planet to repair the ship. He travels from planet to planet to acquire new parts required for the repair of the ship and going off the star system Xeodrifter got trapped in.
Gameplay</h3>
Xeodrifter is a typical Metroidvania game. It is a two-dimensional platforming game that features immense interconnected maps which feature distinctive rooms and sections. The players cannot travel the whole map at first, as some sections of it require a specific ability or equipment to be opened. Sometimes, such items are protected by a unique and powerful enemy that has to be defeated by the players.

An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player&#39;s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role. The player&#39;s interaction with the game dramatically influences the storyline and the ending, as the player nurtures relationships between certain characters, their performance in battle will also improve and the strength of their attacks soars. This means that the game&#39;s social elements are closely tied to the battle system. Sakura Wars carved out a whole new genre for itself, it&#39;s the first in gaming history to combine elements of dating simulation and strategy.
Ichiro Ogami, having just been informed that he will be taking command of the secret corps known as the Imperial Assault Force (帝国華撃団 Teikoku Kagekidan), Flower Division (花組 Hanagumi), arrives in Teito (Imperial Capital Tokyo) and is taken to the Imperial Theater by Sakura Shinguji, who is herself new to the team. Ogami is greatly surprised to find that he has been posted to a theater, and doubly so when he&#39;s informed that he&#39;ll be filling the vital role of clipping tickets of patrons as they come in. Fortunately for his patience, it doesn&#39;t take long for the city to come under attack by evil forces, and he&#39;s quickly informed of his real role and given a quick course on operating the Koubu. Combat ensues, but he is able to push them back, with the aid of the Flower Division members.

Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie.

Zero Strain is my idea of an STG game, without being an STG game. Put another way, all the fun of an STG game without using traditional STG game mechanics.

Thief Simulator,83.5,62.62,62.62,83.5,62.62,62.62,Thief Simulator,"Thief Simulator
Become the real thief. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipement and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers and avoid too much attention from the police. Do anything that a real thief does!
A good thief always observes his target. What&#39;s inside? Who lives there? What&#39;s your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Check if their dog chooses dog snacks over the bone. Dress as a courier or a cop to investigate your target even better. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it&#39;s neighbourhood.
The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don&#39;t exist. When it&#39;s about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you&#39;ll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you&#39;re not shure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!
A real, experienced thief can spot places where there&#39;s most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the scanner to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be. Remember that you can use it only few times during burglary and that it has a limited range.
Get rid of stuff that can lead cops on your track. Turn off the GPS trackers, disconnect all the devices from the internet and erase serial numbers. Disassemblement of an car is expensive, but if it&#39;s a rare model, spending a few dollars may save you a few years in prison. Some of the goods you can sell without investing money in getting rid of tracks, but ultimately the decision is yours. Remember, that if you dont remain careful, cops will eventually knock on your door.
Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Keys, notes with passwords to the alarm systems, or even fridge magnets. All those things can look useless, but can also make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren&#39;t?
Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, your memory portrait will be on every pole in the city. This will seriously impact your intel possibilities and reduce the trading capabilities.
Design your own house. Build a fortress and put it to the test with the Thief Simulator editor. Choose from alarm systems and security devices you&#39;ve already seen to make potential thief&#39;s life a little harder. Get yourself a dog or two. Surround your house with the electrical fence. It all depends on your imagination and wallet of course. See if others can rob you!
Find your neighbour&#39;s house or build it yourself, and find out if it&#39;s easy to rob. Make a bet with frend about who robs the other one first, or join forces, build an unconquerable fortress and put it to the test by sharing it with other players.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Simulation', 'Indie']","['Noble Muffins', 'GrabTheWallet Studio']","['Forever Entertainment', 'PlayWay', 'Stolen Dreams']",08/11/2018,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",2.0,Without info,0.0,3.38,4.0,47.0,138.0,48.0,189.0,103.0,441441.0,thief-simulator,['Singleplayer'],0,0.25005988023952097,0.25005988023952097,885,0.25005988023952097,0.0,,0.19753692614770466,79.28868085106383,5.0,60.0,0.2553191489361702,235.0

Battlefield™ V Edição Definitiva,298.9,74.72,74.72,298.9,74.72,74.72,Battlefield V,"Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. 
Plot</h3>
Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.
Gameplay</h3>
Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player&#39;s interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.
The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.
Modes</h3>
Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure', 'Massively Multiplayer']","['Electronic Arts', 'Electronic Arts DICE', 'Uprise']",['Electronic Arts'],20/11/2018,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",4.0,77,9.0,3.57,4.0,550.0,155.0,559.0,617.0,101.0,1000000.0,battlefield-v,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Full controller support', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Female Protagonist', 'Violent', 'Action-Adventure', 'War', 'PvP', 'Historical', 'Military', 'World War II', 'Destruction', 'combat', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Online PvP', 'LGBTQ+', 'Battle Royale', 'ww2']",0,0.7500167280026765,0.7500167280026765,873,0.7500167280026765,0.0,,0.7000111520017843,260.85757575757566,4.0,30.0,0.1818181818181818,165.0

Dying Light Anniversary Edition,214.9,161.17,161.17,214.9,161.17,161.17,Dying Light,"Dying Light is a first-person action horror game with the elements of survival. It is a first part of the Dying light series followed by Dying Light 2. The game is set in the open-world environment of fictional Harran city. Players are offered to assume the role of an undercover agent Kyle Crane who has been sent in the quarantine zone. His mission is to find the rogue politician Kadir Rais Suleiman lost somewhere in the infected giant city. On the way to achieving the goal, Kyle will meet other survivors, who desperately try to stay alive among zombies. The chief game mechanic is running the generators and turning on streetlights throughout Harran to make another part of the map accessible and safe at nighttime. The game features day/night time cycles that change the game remarkably: the action becomes fast-paced, and all the infected people turn into dangerous zombies. Therefore, the gameplay is based on armed combat against mutants and Kyle’s sneak and parkour skill for preventing it.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG']",['Techland'],['Warner Bros.

Plot</h3>
The game continues the plot of Devil May Cry 2. The demonic threat seems to have been forgotten, but the demons return, and there are new accidents around the world. Nero and Dante have parted ways, and Nero established his own agency. He also received a new robotic arm made by his engineer Nico. It replaces his Devil Bringer prosthetic that was stolen by a villain. At the beginning of the game, Nero rides his van to Red Grave City in which a demonic tree appeared. At the same time, Dante has a new client, a mysterious V, who hires him to investigate the demonic attacks.
Gameplay</h3>
As usual in the Devil May Cry series, the player controls his or her character from the third person view. The game features three playable characters. Dante and Nero make a return, and V is newly introduced. Each of the three characters has a unique fighting style. Nero&#39;s prosthetic hand allows him to use a variety of options, such as pulling his enemies closer. Nero also uses his legendary weapons, the gun called “Blue Rose” and the sword named “Red Queen”. Dante, as usual, fights with his swords Rebellion and Sparda, as well as a variety of new weapons, such as chainsaws and a motorcycle. V uses a walking cane as a weapon.",['Action'],['Capcom'],['Capcom'],08/03/2019,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",10.0,88,7.0,4.24,5.0,1016.0,7573.0,1036.0,468.0,102.0,1000000.0,devil-may-cry-5,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Atmospheric', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Online Co-Op', 'Online multiplayer', 'Violent', 'Action-Adventure', 'Anime', 'Nudity', 'Hack and Slash', '3rd-Person Perspective', 'Demons', 'Character Action Game', 'slasher']",1,0.2,0.2,765,0.2,0.0,,0.16999999999999998,97.9327702702703,6.0,50.0,0.33783783783783783,148.0

Balduq is known as &#39;the prison city&#39; for its large prison facility inside the town and its architecture featuring high walls as a result of being built upon the fortified era. Furthermore the city is an important nexus for transportation in the region resulting in a wide range of inns, bars and trade centers. In more recent years public facilities such as theaters and baths are starting to be developed too.
In more recent years rumours of beings called Monstrum are said to have started appearing creating a huge fuss with its residents. The Monstrum are said to possess unique supernatural abilities, some of them seem to be helping the poor and helpless, others are outlaws up to no good. This dichotomy results in the villagers becoming scared/wary of them.
Balduq Prison, located at the edge of the city, supposedly is the largest prison facility of the Romun empire. Originally it was a fortress built to protect the Romun border, it is more recently that it has been repurposed as a prison facility. Featuring only one entrance through a drawbridge and surrounded by steep rock walls and deep moats it is said to be inescapable. The townsfolk does not hold the prison facility in high regard as the facility also is used to detain critics of the empire as does it detain political prisoners.

It’s up to you to hustle, charm and intimidate your way to the top of the pile and do whatever it takes to stay there. This character-driven, noir-inspired game puts players smack dab in the glitz and glamor of the roaring 20s, all while working behind the scenes in the gritty underbelly of organized crime.
Build A Crime Empire: Raise your criminal empire from the ground up by selecting your racket of choice (be it speakeasies, union protection, or casinos) and building a team of loyal mobsters to make your mark on the streets. Once you make a name for yourself, expand your influence by taking over rival territory and add more endeavors to your repertoire.
Defend and Expand Territory: If it comes to blows, hypothetically of course, and your posse needs to send a message, face off in brutal turn-based combat. Strategically recruit your goons and build a strong chemistry within your crew to maximize combat damage and help secure your hold on the city. 
Living, Breathing World: Explore the streets of vibrant 1920s Chicago and interact with a full cast of living, breathing characters each with lives of their own that inform how they react to what you do (or don’t do). Schmooze, coerce, seduce, threaten, or kill them to get your way.
Wield Your Influence: Make and break alliances, bribe cops, and trade on the black market to raise your faction rating and expand your crime family. But always keep your enemies close and ensure you have a mole on the inside and eyes everywhere.
Multiple Victory Strategies: Whether you make it to the top with violence, social influence, or city-wide notoriety, there are a number of ways to become King or Queen of Chicago. With various starting conditions and constantly changing crew dynamics, no two playthroughs will ever be the same.","['RPG', 'Strategy']",['Romero Games'],"['Paradox Interactive', 'ParadoxInteractive']",01/12/2020,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Nintendo']",5.0,56,0.0,2.44,3.0,9.0,0.0,9.0,193.0,0.0,0.0,empire-of-sin,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'role-playing', 'Turn-Based', 'Crime']",0,0.29999999999999993,0.29999999999999993,131,0.29999999999999993,0.0,,0.29999999999999993,192.14139344262298,1.0,15.0,0.12295081967213115,122.0

Thrust into a tragedy that touches countless lives, you must now make the decisions that will determine who lives and who dies in the chaos stemming from a natural disaster. What will you do in the aftermath of calamity?
When a massive earthquake strikes the city you’re visiting, you find yourself at the epicenter of a chaotic and catastrophic crisis.

Aftershocks, fires, collapsing buildings and debris, and unstable ground are but a few of the threats you’ll face in these nightmarish circumstances. What will you do when every passing second and every snap decision could spell the difference between life and death?
Your World in Chaos - In a city on the brink of collapsing, you’ll need to make split-second decisions that will impact your safety as well as that of others.
Everybody&#39;s Got a Story - Meet your fellow survivors in a Japanese-inspired city devastated by a powerful earthquake, and see how the human spirit bends...and sometimes breaks.

Bereft of his past, Adol explores the town he happened to wander into, searching for any clues at all to his identity. Joined by a thief who claims to have spent some time at his side these past weeks, the young adventurer helps rescue doomed miners from a collapse – an act which ingratiates him to the local Romun Army general. Impressed with their skills, the pair is enlisted to explore the Great Forest of Celceta and map its vast expanses – a task which many have attempted in the past, but from which none have ever returned alive.
Eager to unravel the mystery of his past and the cause of his predicament, Adol sets off with his new-old thief friend, Duren, to chart the untamed wilderness that claimed his memories. Along the way he meets numerous other individuals who seem to have encountered him before, and must carefully determine who among them can be trusted.
Developer Nihon Falcom originally revisited the land and characters of Japanese cult favorite Ys IV in 2012 with Ys: Memories of Celceta on the PlayStation Vita, and the game found its way to North America the following year. Now, this re-envisioning moves from the small screen to PC monitors, with a bevy of updates and enhancements to fully take advantage of its new platform.
Featuring a unique take on the party-based combat system that’s come to define modern Ys titles, as well as one of the largest and most varied overworlds in the series’ long and illustrious history, Ys: Memories of Celceta brings a greater sense of adventure to the Ys universe than ever before, with this PC iteration serving as the definitive version of one of the franchise’s most pivotal entries.Key FeaturesFully Enjoy the Land of Celceta with a Host of PC Enhancements

Indivisible,199.5,99.75,99.75,199.5,74.95,74.95,Indivisible,"Indivisible is an exciting RPG platformer set in an immersive, vibrant world that tells the story of Ajna, a good-natured tomboy with a rebellious streak. Raised by her father on the outskirts of their rural town, her life is thrown into chaos when her home is attacked and a mysterious power awakens within her. Her world now in chaos, Ajna sets out on a quest to save everything she knows from being destroyed.
Key Features:
Masterfully crafted story and characters: Indivisible tells the story of Ajna, and her quest to find redemption for her father and village. Throughout her quest, she’ll encounter an incredibly diverse cast of “Incarnations”, people whom she can absorb into herself and manifest to fight alongside her. There are many Incarnations to recruit, and by uniting unique characters from faraway lands, she will learn about herself and the world she inhabits.
Action-packed battles: Obtain a variety of weapon types, learn new combat skills and recruit more than 25 playable Incarnations to build your battle party and engage monsters in fast-paced, strategic combat.
Beautifully drawn characters and world: Building on its winning formula of 2D, hand-drawn animation with Skullgirls, LabZero draws inspiration from various cultures and mythologies to create visually dynamic environments and a rich cast of characters with unique stories of their own.
Unique Battle System: The key to success is mastering your party’s attacks to create combos, and experimenting with new Incarnations and attacks to make the most out of every round. The active controls allow your party to function as a single, customizable fighting game character while switching between characters and unlocking new attacks as Ajna’s affinity for her weapons develops.
Build your Inner Realm: Along with her ability to absorb certain people, Ajna will also discover she can meditate and enter a mysterious dimension growing inside her. Once she discovers it, Ajna’s Inner Realm becomes the central hub for the game, where most of the game’s quests, upgrade and saving functionality resides. Simply pressing a button will send Ajna to this realm, sparing needless trekking back to towns.
Stellar soundtrack: Lose yourself in a stunning soundtrack by legendary Japanese game music composer Hiroki Kikuta who is responsible for is responsible for the amazing soundtracks to Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu III (Secret of Mana 2), Soukaigi, and Koudelka among others.","['Action', 'RPG', 'Indie']",['Lab Zero Games'],['505 Games'],07/10/2019,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",3.0,79,0.0,3.37,3.0,76.0,0.0,79.0,453.0,101.0,76327.0,indivisible,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'Female Protagonist', 'role-playing', 'india']",0,0.5,0.5,552,0.6243107769423559,0.0,,0.3407616467639687,149.52408108108108,12.0,272.0,0.7351351351351352,370.0

Road grip changes during the race, cars need to be tuned specifically for each special stage, tyre choices and stock management need to be considered, and making proper use of the weather team to get the best advice... The weather is much more than a visual effect - now it&#39;s finally coming into its own, adding a whole new dimension to the game.
In solo mode take on the new challenges of a completely overhauled, more realistic career mode, designed in conjunction with WRC drivers: schedule and activity management between rallies, research and development to improve the car, recruitment and management of your staff (mechanics, engineers, medical and weather teams, financial director, communication manager, etc.).
In multiplayer mode, weekly challenges and eSports WRC  are back and the competition is more intense than ever.
With 50 teams, 14 rallies and more than 100 special stages from the 2019 season, WRC 8 offers the most content ever in an off-road racing game.

Plot</h3>
As the game is set in a science fiction universe, the events span accordingly. The year is 2145, and the technological progress has allowed humanity to set up different facilities on Mars. After an experiment goes wrong, the research center becomes inhabited by demons. The player controls a nameless space marine, fighting off hordes of enemies through a variety of levels. 
Gameplay</h3>
The playable character employs a large arsenal of weaponry for his cause, from common firearms to the series’s trademark BFG9000. Each level of the game is linear, as the player must often either retrieve information, some device or reach the checkpoint. However, there are numerous obstacles on the way to the objective: the protagonist has to fight off not only demons and their servants, but also combat the natural enemy in the form of darkness. 
Graphics and music</h3>

The game became the second in the series Doom, received improved multiplayer, graphics and improved optimization.
Gameplay-wise game is not so different from its predecessor. The developers decided to take advantage of the progress of the computer hardware to fine-tune their game engine. The player still took control of the nameless space marine, which traveled through 30 non-linear levels. A level is considered to be completed after the player finds the coded doors. A rich arsenal of weapons and a variety of models of enemies will not get bored.
The plot continues the story of the first part: after defeating the invasion of demons on the moons of Mars and returning from Hell, the protagonist finds the Earth captured by the creatures that he just conquered. A solo company can be fashioned alone, and in multiplayer, to battle with friends today: for the game, there is a huge amount of third-party mods to play online without using of archaic dial-up connection.","['Action', 'Shooter']","['Bethesda Softworks', 'id Software']","['Valve', 'Bethesda Softworks', 'Activision Blizzard', 'id Software', 'GT Interactive Software', 'Virgin Interactive']",30/09/1994,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Nintendo']",1.0,83,6.0,4.39,5.0,496.0,0.0,499.0,454.0,0.0,1000000.0,doom-ii,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Great Soundtrack', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Online Co-Op', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'Violent', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'Moddable', 'Zombies', ""1990's"", '2.5D', 'Demons', 'vr mod', 'deathmatch']",1,0.5,0.5,9690,0.5,0.0,,0.4814814814814814,17.71380281690141,5.0,81.0,0.22816901408450704,355.0

The part to play is singularly yours. Written just for you.You are met with silence. No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words.
Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.
Darkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity.
A deep and commanding voice rises from the distance. Act.
What part will you play?

It is loosely based on the famous horror story by H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos universe in general.
Plot</h3>
The game is set in 1924 in Massachusetts, USA. The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce&#39;s investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane.

Plot</h3>
The events of Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey&#39;s take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.
Gameplay</h3>
Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin&#39;s Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.","['Action', 'RPG']","['Ubisoft', 'Ubisoft Montreal', 'Ubisoft Shanghai', 'Ubisoft Quebec', 'Ubisoft Montpellier', 'Ubisoft Kiev', 'Ubisoft Bucharest', 'Ubisoft Singapore']",['Ubisoft Entertainment'],05/10/2018,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",32.0,85,14.0,4.04,4.0,1316.0,1957.0,1336.0,644.0,100.0,707097.0,assassins-creed-odyssey,"['Singleplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'Third Person', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Female Protagonist', 'Stealth', 'Captions available', 'In-App Purchases', 'Historical', 'Parkour', 'Assassin']",0,0.7500326101134832,0.7500326101134832,919,0.7500326101134832,0.0,,0.6980645386663039,177.2256741573034,8.0,117.0,0.3286516853932584,356.0

Dead Cells,103.9,72.73,72.73,103.9,51.95,51.95,Dead Cells,"Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin.
Story</h3>
Not much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner&#39;s body, and gets back to the game&#39;s starting area. 
Gameplay</h3>
The game&#39;s heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.
Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.
The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. 
The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can&#39;t take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.","['Action', 'RPG', 'Indie', 'Platformer']","['Plug In Digital', 'Playdigious', 'Motion Twin']","['Plug In Digital', 'Playdigious', 'Motion Twin']",07/08/2018,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Nintendo']",9.0,88,0.0,4.26,4.0,1053.0,6762.0,1068.0,421.0,101.0,344021.0,dead-cells,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', '2D', 'Difficult', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Hack and Slash', 'Early Access', 'Replay Value', 'Side Scroller', 'Roguelike', 'Metroidvania', 'Roguelite', 'Procedural Generation', 'Perma Death']",0,0.30000000000000004,0.30000000000000004,978,0.5,0.0,,0.3776667417525034,93.65411111111112,7.0,94.0,0.2611111111111111,360.0

Once again, the player controls Rufus, a selfish yet loveable rogue, who tries to leave his home planet Deponia and move to the luxurious space station Elysium. His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you.
Chaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters. Like in most adventure games, the protagonist has to use various items to solve puzzles. Those are quite complex right from the start, and there’s no growing difficulty over the course of Chaos on Deponia.","['Adventure', 'RPG', 'Indie']",['Daedalic Entertainment'],['Daedalic Entertainment'],12/10/2012,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux']",5.0,78,3.0,4.1,4.0,223.0,0.0,223.0,495.0,80.0,108127.0,chaos-on-deponia,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Sci-fi', '2D', 'Funny', 'Comedy', 'Point & Click', 'Dystopian', 'achievements', 'Dark Humor', 'Hand-drawn']",0,0.9,0.9,3103,0.9,0.0,,0.7384309567983036,39.93069637883007,8.0,126.0,0.35097493036211697,359.0

Gameplay</h3>
Despite the trend made by NFS&#39; before Payback features an offline mode. The game is set in a fictional city named Fortune Valley. The player can choose between the three individuals to represent. The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player&#39;s liking. 
There is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner. All the modes share the goal — to reach the finish. However, the initial purpose is altered depending on the race — sometimes one has to drift his way to the finish line, somewhere the manual transmission turns one, and the gear switching comes to be mandatory.
Plot</h3>
Payback is one of few NFS&#39; to feature ongoing narrative — the story of this one emphasizes the revenge theme. Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time.

Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy™,59.5,29.75,29.75,59.5,22.95,22.95,Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy,"The game that started Jak and Daxter series is a mixture of 3D platforming and puzzles delivered in a cartoonish visual style.
Setting</h3>
Jak and Daxter’s world is a distant fantasy planet. It is dominated by the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization, the Precursors. This civilization also created eco, a type of energy that comes in different colors and can be used to various effects. There’s the dark eco that can distort life, and its Dark Sage, Gol Acheron, is going to unleash it on the world. He sent his servants, the Lurkers, to gather eco for him.
Plot</h3>
The player assumes the role of Jak, a mute yet troublemaking teenage boy. His best friend is a boy called Daxter. When the two explored the forbidden ruins, the Lurkers attacked them. Daxter came under the influence of dark eco and mutated into a mixture of otter and weasel he calls “ottsel.” He can still talk, however, and will comment on Jak’s actions throughout the game. Jak learns that only Gol Acheron can bring Daxter back to normal. The boy, accompanied by Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a dangerous journey to save his friend and the world.
Gameplay</h3>
Much of the gameplay is centered around collecting items and resources. On each level, Jak has to obtain power cells to activate Precursors’ machines and advance to the next area. Other collectibles, such as eco particles, improve the protagonist’s attacks, health, or speed. Jak’s attacks are mostly hand-to-hand, but yellow eco allows him to shoot bolts.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Arcade']","['Sony Interactive Entertainment', 'Naughty Dog']",['Sony Computer Entertainment'],04/12/2001,Everyone 10+,['PlayStation'],1.0,Without info,3.0,3.96,4.0,316.0,0.0,317.0,192.0,100.0,258827.0,jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy,"['puzzles', 'shoot', 'speed', 'ancient', 'colors']",0,0.5,0.5,7068,0.6142857142857143,0.0,,0.33487975835495504,47.38851540616246,8.0,217.0,0.6078431372549019,357.0

Elite Dangerous,149.5,59.8,59.8,149.5,44.85,43.71,Elite Dangerous,"One of the interesting facts about Elite Dangerous is its realistic scale representation of the Milky Way which is an open-world and the gameplay is itself open-ended. It is the first game in the series to feature MMO-kind of gameplay, where every players&#39; action affects the plot of the games universe. This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it&#39;s the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
Elite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. 
There are three different factions in the game including Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems and four player status levels (combat, CQC Championship, exploration and trading).","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG', 'Simulation', 'Massively Multiplayer']",['Frontier Developments'],['Frontier Developments'],02/04/2015,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh']",14.0,80,1.0,3.98,4.0,320.0,0.0,324.0,520.0,100.0,1000000.0,elite-dangerous,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Online Co-Op', 'Difficult', 'Sandbox', 'Exploration', 'Space', 'VR', 'mmo', 'Trading', 'Space Sim', 'TrackIR']",1,0.6000000000000001,0.6000000000000001,2201,0.7,0.0,,0.3915867356597463,114.53957746478874,11.0,212.0,0.5971830985915494,355.0

Friday the 13th: The Game is a third-person horror, survival game where players take on the role of a teen counselor, or for the first time ever, Jason Voorhees. You and six other unlucky souls will do everything possible to escape and survive while the most well-known killer in the world tracks you down and brutally slaughters you.  Friday the 13th: The Game will strive to give every single player the tools to survive, escape or even try to take down the man who cannot be killed. Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals!
Meanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine. Take control of the legendary killer that is Jason Voorhees and terrify those unfortunate enough to cross your path!
Play as Jason Voorhees!
For the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You’ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!
Jason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!
Fans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including:
Friday the 13th, Part II
Friday the 13th, Part III
Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives
Friday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood
Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan
Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday
How Will You Survive?
The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.
Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!
Play as the Counselors!
We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!
Camp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!
Mirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey.
Players will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!
Your Crystal Lake Database
Friday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you&#39;ll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you&#39;ll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols!

Ys Origin,83.5,33.4,33.4,83.5,33.4,33.4,Ys Origin,"700 years before the events of Ys I &amp; II, the land of Ys was on the brink of destruction. Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.
One day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there&#39;s only one place they could have gone: the Devil&#39;s Tower.
A search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact.
This is their story. Or at least, it&#39;s how each of them remembers it.
Expanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon.
Come see how long you can last in the Devil&#39;s Tower...Key Features:Officially available in English for the very first time.

Gameplay</h3>
The player takes a role of the famous dungeon explorer set to go as far as he can in his explorations. The protagonist — his name always varies depending on the skills and background chosen — examines the 2D levels consisting of destructible and indestructible blocks filled with enemies.
There is a variety of spells, weaponry, and foes usual to RPGs. Every once in a while a player encounters a boss. All the progress except for the skill points is lost after death. Between the respawns the protagonist can upgrade the level of his successors using the goods he found on his previous dungeon run.
The title feature split-screen cooperative and online multiplayer for a maximum of 4 characters. The game is highly replayable due to the procedurally generated of the environment. The game suggests only going down into the dungeon thus the name. The skills may bring variety into descending every time.

Gameplay</h3>
You play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.
It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player&#39;s stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. 
In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they&#39;re moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.

Overcooked Holiday Bundle,83.5,25.05,25.05,83.5,24.6,24.6,Overcooked,"Overcooked puts the player into the shoes of two restaurant chefs at once. Each level is a kitchen, and your goal is to cook a list of meals following the onscreen recipes. The time is limited, and there are restrictions on how much money the player can spend on the ingredients. The player controls two characters that can be switched at any time or ordered to do a list of actions. 
The kitchens are often set in the oddball places, such as a pirate ship, two speeding trucks, a pedestrian crosswalk, or an iceberg. The level elements are dynamic and may move or change during the gameplay. Tables and ovens can slide, and the cooks can fall off the level, though they will respawn shortly. 
There’s a story mode in which cooking is tied to the plot. The game is set in the Onion Kingdom that was attacked by an insatiable spaghetti monster. The chefs travel back in time to refine their cooking skills and feed the monster when it appears again.
Since even in the single mode the player has to control two cooks, the game predictably has a co-op multiplayer and a competitive mode in which the players try to “outcook” each other. Both modes, however, are local, and there’s no online multiplayer.","['Simulation', 'Arcade', 'Casual', 'Indie']","['Team17 Digital', 'Ghost Town Games']",['Team17 Digital'],01/08/2016,Everyone,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",4.0,81,1.0,4.09,4.0,991.0,0.0,996.0,316.0,0.0,519584.0,overcooked,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', 'Funny', 'Difficult', 'Split Screen', 'Local Co-Op', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Family Friendly', 'Memes', 'Colorful', '4 Player Local', 'Co-op Campaign']",0,0.7,0.7,1714,0.7053892215568862,0.0,,0.5793222066505288,64.39453781512604,9.0,141.0,0.3949579831932774,357.0

While in captivity, the boy’s first task is to befriends his cellmate, a fantasy creature named Trico, who is a gigantic half-bird, half-cat hybrid that slightly reminds a hippogriff. Trico is the second main character and the mascot of The Last Guardian; the creature’s animation is incredibly detailed, and its behavior is modeled after real animals. The two form an unlikely symbiosis. The boy needs the creature’s strength and ability to fly to overcome obstacles and fend off guards who try to bring the characters back to their cells. Trico, in turn, needs the boy’s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds. The player only controls the boy, while Trico needs to be manipulated into performing certain actions.

Plot</h3>
The game is set in an alternate version of USSR in the eighties. The government cannot do anything with widespread crime, so it simply ignores that. Four street fighters from a gypsy community unwillingly become the test subjects for a new drug called Necro. After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts. The protagonist becomes eager to get revenge on those, who did that. Further into the game, the main character starts taking Necro themselves, which causes horrible hallucinations.
Gameplay</h3>
Mother Russia Bleeds is a beat &#39;em up game which is largely inspired by titles such as Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.
The players advance through a level, that is divided into multiple sections. In progress further, the players have to kill every enemy they encounter in a section. At the end of each level, a boss fight is held.
Apart from hand-to-hand combat, the players can use the world&#39;s items, such as pipes, knives, bottles, and pistols. One of the defining features of the game is the health regeneration system, as the players can pump Necro out of their enemies corpses and eject them to themselves. A choice is given - regenerate health or become a berserk that has much more strength and speed.
The game can either be completed solo or in a four-player co-op.","['Action', 'Arcade', 'Fighting', 'Indie']","['Devolver Digital', 'Le Cartel Studio']",['Devolver Digital'],04/09/2016,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",3.0,70,0.0,3.56,4.0,179.0,0.0,181.0,581.0,100.0,46461.0,mother-russia-bleeds,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', '2D', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Difficult', 'Gore', 'Female Protagonist', 'Split Screen', 'Local Co-Op', 'Violent', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'controller support', 'Mature', 'Memes', ""Beat 'em up"", '4 Player Local', 'Illuminati']",0,0.8,0.8,1680,0.8,0.0,,0.36699321443138416,60.520564971751405,8.0,181.0,0.5112994350282486,354.0

Welcome to San-Francisco. It is the second city in the United States to install the city-wide operating system named ctOS, which connects everything from your car to your smart home to a global network. Marcus Holloway is tagged by the system as a suspect for a crime he did not commit. Marcus decides to take action and gets together with the hacktivist group DedSec to expose ctOS and its creators.
WD2 offers the player an immense open world which consists of San-Francisco, Oakland, Marin and Silicon Valley. It&#39;s the player&#39;s choice to navigate the world on foot or on a wide range of vehicles from cars to boats.

Released in 2016, the remastered version of one of the most revolutionary parts of the annual Call of Duty series. In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.
Key features</h3>
In the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.
The changes</h3>
The main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.","['Action', 'Shooter']","['Raven Software', 'Activision', 'Beenox']",['Activision Blizzard'],05/10/2016,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",5.0,86,24.0,3.95,4.0,833.0,0.0,837.0,318.0,100.0,1000000.0,call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Online Co-Op', 'Online multiplayer', 'Violent', 'War', 'Remake']",1,0.5,0.5,1649,0.6901291989664082,0.0,,0.3393289523734572,157.06323943661968,7.0,197.0,0.5549295774647889,355.0

The plot is centered around the city of Ubersreik that was recently taken over by a horde of rat-like monsters called Skavens. The players, who can team up in groups of up to four, are tasked with cleaning the streets from the dirty invaders. There are thirteen levels with different objectives, some of which involve collecting certain items or protecting a city well from being poisoned.
The gameplay is strongly reminiscent of that in Left 4 Dead series, in which the protagonists have to slaughter monsters coming in large numbers, using both melee and ranged weapons. There are five character classes, each with its unique specialization: the Dwarf Ranger and the Empire Soldier are strong and slow, the Witch Hunter and the Waywatcher are the fast scouts, and the Bright Wizard uses magic. On the levels, the players can find item perks that either restore health or ammo or buff the character. It is essential to fairly distribute the perks across the party, especially since every player can only have one perk in each category at a time.","['Action', 'Indie']",['Fatshark'],['Fatshark'],23/10/2015,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",5.0,79,1.0,3.51,4.0,330.0,0.0,333.0,669.0,0.0,154110.0,warhammer-end-times-vermintide,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'Partial Controller Support', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Online Co-Op', 'Gore', 'Female Protagonist', 'Survival', 'Action RPG', 'Hack and Slash', 'Captions available', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Games Workshop']",1,0.8,0.8,1997,0.8500290866783013,0.0,,0.3908722453003849,131.6986797752809,7.0,213.0,0.5983146067415731,356.0

Plot</h3>
As its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don&#39;t trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together.
Gameplay</h3>
Virginia&#39;s gameplay is similar to interactive movies and walking simulators. The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what&#39;s going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it.
Style</h3>
The game is made in an intentionally low-poly visual style. There are no dialogues, neither in subtitles nor voice acting. The player can only understand the narrative through the facial expressions and body language of the characters, as well as the other clues.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Casual', 'Indie']","['505 Games', 'Variable State']",['505 Games'],21/09/2016,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh']",3.0,74,0.0,3.28,4.0,192.0,0.0,198.0,251.0,102.0,657283.0,virginia,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', 'Horror', 'Female Protagonist', 'Nudity', 'Captions available', 'Mystery', 'Walking Simulator', 'Cinematic', 'overlay', 'Detective', ""1990's""]",0,0.8,0.8,1663,0.8,0.0,,0.35487642293098143,43.177633802816906,5.0,199.0,0.5605633802816901,355.0

The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.

After settling down to recover from the responsibilities of working life, the residents of Sunny Pines have been idling away the days, life could not be more tranquil. 

However, a creepy new resident, Mr Grim Reaper, looks set to turn retirement on its head. After years trawling the earth for souls to harvest, Mr Grim Reaper concludes Sunny Pines is where he’ll lay his hat, where he can harvest souls from the comfort of his rocking chair. However, seven of the sprightliest senior citizens have other ideas and set out to prove that life for Grim in Sunny Pines definitely won't be like shooting fish in a barrel.

The stately seven decide to strike a deal with the Grim Reaper; a mobility scooter racing championship to the death. If they can prove themselves to be fast and full of life, surviving and ultimately winning the championship, then he will allow them to live. However, too slow and they will be condemned to the retirement village in the sky.

Plot</h3>
The game is set in the ruins of Washington D.C. in the near future, some seven months after the events of the original game. The smallpox epidemic devastated much of the United States, leaving it with multiple contamination zones. A civil war breaks out among the factions of survivors as the gangs of raiders terrorize the capital. The main characters are the elite members of the Strategic Homeland Division. Their task is to bring law and order back to Washington.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls his or her Division agent from the third person view. The game is set in an open world modeled after the real Washington D.C., including all of its famous landmarks. Tom Clancy&#39;s The Division 2 combines elements of tactical shooters and role-playing games. The agents have customizable abilities, weapons, and tools, and can level up. When they reach level 30, they receive a specialization: Survivalist, Demolitionist, or Sharpshooter. The game also unlocks new co-op missions.
Modes</h3>
Besides the story campaign mode, the game has two multiplayer modes: player versus player and cooperative. Up to eight players can join forces on a raid.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure', 'RPG']","['Ubisoft', 'Massive Entertainment']",['Ubisoft Entertainment'],15/03/2019,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Web']",0.0,83,1.0,3.77,4.0,549.0,0.0,554.0,668.0,101.0,1000000.0,division-2,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'Open World', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Third-Person Shooter', 'Action-Adventure', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'MMORPG']",0,0.7500244498777506,0.7500244498777506,758,0.7923227383863081,0.0,,0.3057843919964074,169.87725988700566,5.0,196.0,0.5536723163841808,354.0

Yarni arises in the human house, from the tangle of yarn used for knitting by the inhabitants of this house. Yarni moves around the house, goes into the yard, examines the neighborhood. It is small and therefore a mug, flower bed or children&#39;s bicycle are obstacles in its way. But the yarn that Yarni is made of is subject to him, he can catch on to the object, pull himself up and climb up, swing and jump, maybe even pull yarn and walk along it like a tightrope walker. The variety of these techniques is large enough, tips help to use them. You can interact with all objects, sometimes there are creatures that can block the path - for example, insects.
Yarn can not be unrolled indefinitely, it is necessary to monitor its consumption. Sometimes you can return the unwound yarn back to the body, sometimes you can increase the amount of yarn, finding a new piece.
The most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he comes himself. Memories are painted with different emotions, a sufficient number of collected memories opens the entrance to the following levels. In the game there are two lines of events. Events of the past arise as memories, they are found by Yarni. At the same time, the Yarni journey goes in the present - and also serves as a source of events that make up not the past but the present.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Arcade', 'Puzzle', 'Platformer']","['Electronic Arts', 'Coldwood Interactive']",['Electronic Arts'],09/02/2016,Everyone,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",1.0,78,1.0,3.97,4.0,543.0,0.0,544.0,486.0,101.0,695867.0,unravel,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Atmospheric', 'Full controller support', 'Family Friendly', 'Colorful', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'island', 'Puzzle Platformer', 'cat', 'children', 'flower', 'small-size', 'wolly']",0,0.7500476644423261,0.7500476644423261,1888,0.882745471877979,0.0,,0.5608942928575282,61.10219101123596,11.0,265.0,0.7443820224719102,356.0

Journey™ Collector’s Edition,83.99,33.59,33.59,83.99,20.15,20.15,Journey,"Journey is an indie game placed in a setting of the vast desert. The protagonist is a nameless and speechless figure moving towards the distant mountain. The player gets to know the story without words, but rather through cutscenes. The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. 
The game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another’s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.","['Adventure', 'Family', 'Indie']","['Sony Interactive Entertainment', 'Annapurna Interactive', 'thatgamecompany', 'Tricky Pixels']","['Sony Computer Entertainment', 'Annapurna Interactive', 'Annapurna Games']",13/03/2012,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'iOS']",2.0,92,0.0,4.35,5.0,1831.0,1464.0,1841.0,277.0,102.0,1000000.0,journey,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'Story Rich', 'cooperative', 'Online Co-Op', 'Classic', 'Exploration', 'Family Friendly', 'Mystery', '3rd-Person Perspective', 'Music', '3D', 'Stylized', 'Masterpiece', 'Beautiful', 'calm', 'peaceful']",1,0.6000714370758423,0.6000714370758423,3316,0.7600904869627336,0.0,,0.7075842362185973,73.30595505617976,4.0,64.0,0.1797752808988764,356.0

Ivo has returned to her gilded cage in the elf kingdom, overprotected by her controlling mother.
Nate along with his trusty companion Critter has been taken prisoner on the flying island of his arch-enemy the Red Pirate.

The game is set in a weird post-apocalyptic future, where the human civilization was taken over by the birds.

They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers.

Gameplay</h3>
You play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.
It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player&#39;s stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. 
In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they&#39;re moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.

Ultratron,41.5,6.22,6.22,41.5,6.22,6.22,Ultratron,"Ultratron is a 2D top-down twin-stick shooter set in the fictional universe and inspired by Robotron: 2084 — an arcade video game about robots.
Gameplay</h3>
The player controls a robot and explores the locations as he pleases — there is no forcing to go further or backward. Traditionally, the left stick accounts for aiming and the right sticks sets the direction of fire. Not only the robot can utilize the firearms, but the explosives alongside with other throwables are available. The customization takes place between the levels — upgrades may be found on the battlefield and present themselves as score points which may develop one of the robot&#39;s characteristics: shields, smart bombs, droid power or so.
There are forty levels in total, with every fifth being the assault one — the foes are more aggressive and unwelcoming there, and every tenth is a boss level. The goal of every level is to eliminate all the enemies and get to the end of the location. The title sometimes features the bullet hell elements — there are so many enemies on-screen, they start forming a distinct pattern recognizable as a picture.
Plot</h3>
The setting is near post-apocalyptic future, where the brains were taken out of the humans and implanted into the war robots, who fight their way to the humans left to defend them from their dreadful fate.","['Action', 'Arcade', 'Indie']","['Curve Digital', 'Carbon', 'Puppygames']","['Curve Digital', 'Puppy Games']",18/03/2013,Everyone,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",2.0,Without info,0.0,3.01,3.0,81.0,0.0,82.0,362.0,74.0,16390.0,ultratron,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Sci-fi', '2D', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Split Screen', 'Local Co-Op', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'Robots', ""Shoot 'Em Up"", 'Twin Stick Shooter']",0,0.8501204819277108,0.8501204819277108,2946,0.8501204819277108,0.0,,0.6184111445783133,34.54025423728814,6.0,96.0,0.2711864406779661,354.0

Due to the ideas and designs of charismatic president Demetrio Watts, the corporation developed new technologies producing higher quantities of energy at a lower cost, granting them near-absolute control of the market. 

The friendly policies enforced by Prometheus and Demetrio Watts has made citizens confident they will have access to electricity in their houses every day. However, very few of them are aware of what's behind Demetrio Watts' smile or behind the scenes in Prometheus Corporation. Secret plans. Terrible plans. Plans which will take the population by surprise. When they realize what is going on, it will already be too late. 

A group of rebels are the only ones who know Demetrio and his company's true intentions, and will do everything it takes to bring the truth to light about the person who pretends to be their eternal benefactor. It will not be easy or agreeable, but the danger behind what Prometheus hides within is a threat to all. Stopping Demetrio Watts is in the hands of a group of unknowns.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. 

Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 &amp; DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player.

In Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.  The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head. 

Even though it’s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you’re on the ship.

The Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience. 

There is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who’s the ultimate Infinity Runner.

Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action game bundle and with it re-invents the running genre!

STARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION
Over 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown.","['Action', 'Indie']",['Wales Interactive'],['Wales Interactive'],14/07/2014,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",4.0,56,0.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,0.0,7.0,405.0,14.0,153283.0,infinity-runner,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Full controller support', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Space', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Parkour', 'VR', 'Runner', 'Werewolves']",0,0.7,0.7,2463,0.7501694915254238,0.0,,0.7374145360528583,25.86410764872521,3.0,59.0,0.1671388101983003,353.0

But now one brave clone learned his real purpose and is going to escape to freedom. 
Gameplay in Stealth Inc. 2 is centered around stealth action, for which the game was even compared to the Splinter Cell series despite huge stylistic differences. The clone has to move swiftly and silently to avoid security cameras and sentry robots. Its time is limited, however, and the player has to find the balance between speed and safety. Level design in Stealth Inc. 2 reminds of Metroidvania-style platformers. The factory is split into areas, consisting of eight test chambers each, all of them interconnected in the manner called overworld. The player will have to solve puzzles to open new areas. Every area introduces a gadget that should be equipped and is essential to use to move forward. Some of the puzzles are deadly traps that are only solved through trial and error. On the first walkthrough, they will almost inevitably kill the clone and send it back to the checkpoint.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie', 'Puzzle']","['NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios', 'Curve Digital', 'Carbon']",['Curve Digital'],30/10/2014,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Android', 'Nintendo']",4.0,Without info,1.0,2.87,3.0,181.0,0.0,181.0,321.0,0.0,16423.0,stealth-inc-2-game-of-clones,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', '2D', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Stealth', 'Includes level editor', 'controller support', 'Metroidvania', 'Puzzle-Platformer', 'puzzles']",0,0.8500927643784787,0.8500927643784787,2355,0.8500927643784787,0.0,,0.414659397206567,40.55287323943661,7.0,212.0,0.5971830985915492,355.0

Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.
Limbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.
The simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death.

The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. 
Injustice: Gods Among Us is followed by the sequel Injustice 2.","['Action', 'Arcade', 'Fighting']","['NetherRealm Studios', 'High Voltage Software', 'Armature Studio']",['Warner Bros.

Having this three different characters, it is necessary to use all three of them to solve puzzles and beat the level.

It features an inclusive, politically aware story, with narrative beats about community, identity and activism. It has pretty pixel art and moody music. And it was made by Analgesic studios, the two-person team behind one of my favorite titles of 2013, Anodyne, a beautiful, pointed take on 2D Zelda-style games.That was always going to speak to me. But what I found in Even the Ocean surprised me even further: It's not just a good game, but a milestone for a sensitive, thoughtful studio working in an uncertain and often downright scary world.""-Danielle Riendeau for Waypoint""Perhaps even more intriguing, though, is how this energy system affects the logic and culture of Even the Ocean‘s world. It makes sense that the tallest city, Whitforge City, and its celestial spire runs on Light energy. Given that it relies on the power plants that Aliph restores to keep running, the city and its Light energy also come to represent industrialism and science.""-Chris Priestman for Killscreen""Even the Ocean is a shining example of how we should be treating diversity and accessibility in games paired with interesting plaforming challenges.""-Affinity Archives Steam Curator~Youtube Gameplay FootageEven The Ocean (1): Super Accessible, Chill Narrative Platformer by Sir TapTapSmash Look! - Even The Ocean Gameplay by Smash GaminG!! - Frazzz</ul>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG', 'Arcade', 'Indie', 'Platformer']","['Joni Kittaka', 'Sean Han Tani', 'Analgesic Productions']",['Analgesic Productions'],15/11/2016,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh']",3.0,Without info,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,400.0,0.0,0.0,even-the-ocean,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', '2D', 'Female Protagonist', 'Pixel Graphics', 'controller support', 'Side Scroller', 'overlay', 'Colorful', 'LGBTQ+']",0,0.4,0.4,1608,0.4,0.0,,0.3069547161224258,70.47528384279477,5.0,88.0,0.3842794759825327,229.0

Hellpoint,187.9,103.34,103.34,187.9,103.34,103.34,Hellpoint,"Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.
You play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.
In the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.
Hellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.
In Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.
Irid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.
Hellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we&#39;ve had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.
For centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?
Hellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.
The more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.
A terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...
Every time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG', 'Indie']",['Cradle Games'],"['tinyBuild', 'Cradle Games']",30/07/2020,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",1.0,60,0.0,3.23,3.0,12.0,0.0,13.0,489.0,0.0,0.0,hellpoint,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Split Screen', 'Local Co-Op', 'Violent', 'stats', 'Local Multiplayer', 'role-playing']",0,0.4500266098988824,0.4500266098988824,255,0.4500266098988824,0.0,,0.3026620232823698,164.1848987854251,5.0,103.0,0.41700404858299606,247.0

He calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation Organnon, to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots.

Empire of Sin - Deluxe Edition,264.9,185.43,185.43,264.9,185.43,185.43,Empire of Sin,"Empire of Sin, the strategy game from Romero Games and Paradox Interactive, puts you at the heart of the ruthless criminal underworld of 1920s Prohibition-era Chicago. It’s up to you to hustle, charm and intimidate your way to the top of the pile and do whatever it takes to stay there. This character-driven, noir-inspired game puts players smack dab in the glitz and glamor of the roaring 20s, all while working behind the scenes in the gritty underbelly of organized crime.
Build A Crime Empire: Raise your criminal empire from the ground up by selecting your racket of choice (be it speakeasies, union protection, or casinos) and building a team of loyal mobsters to make your mark on the streets. Once you make a name for yourself, expand your influence by taking over rival territory and add more endeavors to your repertoire.
