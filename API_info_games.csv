0,La-Mulana,13252,"<p>In La-Mulana, the player assumes the role of an adventurer archeologist and explores the ruins of a forgotten ancient civilization.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The game follows an archeologist named Lemeza Kosugi. He continues the research of the lost city of La-Mulana that was started by his father Shorn. La-Mulana is a magical place that the protagonist believes was the source of all human civilizations. Its architecture consists of a mixture of various ancient cultures, such as Greek, Egyptian or Maya. Lemeza discovers that all human civilizations were created by an alien &quot;Mother&quot; with a goal to help it return to space.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls Lemeza in a 2D environment. The main character has to explore the levels that consist of many mazes, platforms, and environmental puzzles. The levels are non-linear, and the player can complete the game in a variety of ways, although there are no alternate endings. Lemeza can use his whip to fight enemies or to break some parts of the environment to clear the way.</p>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>The game intentionally imitates the retro style of 16-bit console games from the 90s. It uses a limited color palette and pixelated visuals. La-Mulana is also obviously inspired by the Indiana Jones film series. The main character wears a fedora, fights with a whip and is very similar to Indiana. The game is set to the music typically associated with old adventure films.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie', 'Platformer']",['NIGORO'],"['AGM PLAYISM', 'NIS America', 'Active Gaming Media', 'EnjoyUp Games']",2012-07-12,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",3,80,0,3.41,4,59,0,59,362,101,133895,la-mulana,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', '2D', 'Difficult', 'Classic', 'Exploration', 'Controller', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'Action-Adventure', 'controller support', 'Side Scroller', 'overlay', 'Metroidvania', 'Remake', 'Puzzle-Platformer', 'Ninja']"
0,La-Mulana 2,59154,"La-Mulana 2 features sprawling ancient ruins, mind-boggling mysteries, untold numbers of items, and terrible enemies combining to form what is possibly the perfect Metroidvania-style ""archaeological ruin exploration action game"".<br/><br/>In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous title’s hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.<br/><br/>Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.<br/><br/>You won’t believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...<br/><br/><br/>La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.<br/><br/><strong>A classic experience</strong>: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.<br/><br/><strong>Explore at your own pace</strong>: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings. <br/><br/><strong>A colossal adventure</strong>: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.<br/><br/><strong>New horrors, new weapons</strong>: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.<br/><br/><strong>Widescreen support</strong>: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.<br/><br/>The question we’ve asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruins<br/></li><li>Gather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruins<br/></li><li>Dive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progress<br/></li><li>A detailed and beautifully dot-rendered world<br/></li><li>Seven main weapons and over ten sub-weapons<br/></li><li>Over 60 items of various types to help you explore the ruins<br/></li><li>Over 20 apps to install on your trusty adventurer’s tablet, the ""Mobile Super X3""<br/></li><li>Includes reference book with over 200 monsters and other characters in the game<br/><br/><br/>Lumisa Kosugi(21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child.

0,Espire 1: VR Operative,46907,"Espire 1: VR Operative is an ambitious new virtual reality game and IP with its sights firmly set on the single-player ‘stealth’ genre, currently available through Steam's Alpha Release Channel in its prototype phase. We pitch this as ""Goldeneye 007"" meets ""Metal Gear Solid"" in an immersive VR world. <br/>
<br/>
The prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. <br/>
<br/>
Players assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their ""Espire Control Theatre"" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The ""Control Theatre"" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement. <br/>
<br/>
The full game features 15 objective-based missions and 200 Virtual Challenges.","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure']",['Espire VR'],['Espire VR'],2020-06-30,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",12,Without info,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,205,0,0,espire-1-vr-operative,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Cloud', 'Gore', 'Violent', 'stats', 'Captions available', 'VR']"

It's for these reasons that I've decided to destroy everything that isn't cool. With MechaNika I will destroy and eliminate the things and the people that I don't like. I'll start at home. Then school. This city. The entire world. I'll get rid of everything that's boring and pointless, and this world will be better for it. <br/><br/><strong>If it's not cool, it will disappear. If you're not cool, hide. MechaNika is here.</strong><strong>THE GAME</strong><br/>Meet Nika, an intelligent girl that doesn’t fit the world in which she lives. Perhaps it’s the chocolate shake with a shot of cognac which she carries in her backpack which makes her different. Or maybe it’s the fact that at 7 years old her favourite things are the transfer of energy, magnetic fields and electrical engineering! But being the odd one out doesn’t matter to Nika. Not anymore.

<p>In The Outer Worlds, you awake from hibernation on a colonist ship that was lost in transit to Halcyon, the furthest colony from Earth located at the edge of the galaxy, only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy it. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.</p>
<p>Key Features<br />
The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.</p>
<p>You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren&#39;t particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.</p>
<p>Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It&#39;s up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.</p>
<p>Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure', 'RPG']",['Obsidian Entertainment'],['Private Division'],2019-10-25,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",5,80,1,3.95,4,857,0,884,434,101,336406,the-outer-worlds,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Action RPG', 'Space', 'role-playing', 'Choices Matter']"

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for ""Contraptions"" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.<br/><br/>Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds<br/></li><li>Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it<br/></li><li>Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs<br/></li><li>Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like</li></ul><br/>Gameplay<br/>On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. <br/><br/>This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. <br/><br/>When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. <br/><br/>If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.<br/><br/>Gadgets<br/>Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. <br/><br/>Objectives<br/>There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.<br/><br/>The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","['Action', 'Indie', 'Puzzle']","['Moragam, Co']",['Funbox Media'],2019-10-09,Everyone,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Nintendo']",0,Without info,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,264,0,0,contraptions,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Funny', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Physics']"

0,Torchlight II,17126,"<p>Torchlight II is the second installment in the series, and while it continues the story of its predecessor, it also allows new players to jump right into the action-packed roguelike RPG world. The genre itself is well-established already with giants like Diablo series, but Torchlight offers the fresh experience for veterans and newbies alike.<br />
  The steampunk fantasy world lets players enjoy the lush grass of various beautiful environments, the glowing caves filled with mushrooms, and the endless deserts with their treasures! Lots of different enemies always try their best to stop our adventurers from their goal. From every corner there comes danger, only briefly allowing the players to collect their thoughts and dive yet again in battle with evil.<br />
  Following Torchlight, the second game starts with chaos erupting from underneath the world. A crazed former hero now takes the lead of hordes of different creatures, and in defeating him and his minions lies the ultimate goal of our new heroes. Take on the mantle of one of the four available classes, and be sure to utilize their might at its fullest. Stay flexible, for the treasure is always surprising, and don’t forget to use your trusty companion as the aid in battle, or as a heavy-packed war mule. Be ready for harsh defeats, or, if you feel like immortal, try the hardest difficulty for the ultimate roguelike challenge.

0,Fade to Silence,50572,"<p>As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive.<br />
In order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons.<br />
“You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today.<br />
The wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?”<br />
Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.<br />
“You’re out hunting. The barren, snow-filled landscape is endless and unrelenting. A Ripper comes out of nowhere, and you fight it off, narrowly dodging its gigantic claws.<br />
Then you see it: a distant fire. Another person? Impossible. But there’s a strange noise—a voice?  Wild hope sears your heart; you won’t be alone anymore. The voice in your head steps in, discouraging you from investigating. “Anyone living must have done terrible things to survive”, it says. You quiet the voice, defying it this time, and move in closer. Another person could help you rebuild, gather food, harvest deer. You see someone—yes! Someone else is out here. Then, you hear a scream. But you hesitate. How can you trust them? Another scream, desperate. There’s only one way to find out.”Features:Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area.<br />

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>Exodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth&#39;s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series&#39; canon). </p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']",['4A Games'],['Deep Silver'],2019-02-13,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",11,81,5,4.07,4,886,1429,900,632,100,610547,metro-exodus,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Exploration', 'Stealth', 'Violent', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'Survival Horror', 'Cinematic', 'Crafting', 'steam', 'category', 'meat', 'russia']"

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists&#39; storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character&#39;s POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.</p>
<h3>Changes from the original</h3>
<p>Besides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player&#39;s character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle.

0,Fallout 76,58585,"<p>Fallout 76 is a multiplayer-only game set in the universe of Fallout series. It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.</p>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other&#39;s settlements.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG']",['Bethesda Game Studios'],['Bethesda Softworks'],2018-11-14,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",6,51,7,2.67,1,381,6928,387,399,105,841677,fallout-76,"['Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'Open World', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Horror', 'Funny', 'Online Co-Op', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Comedy', 'Exploration', 'Violent', 'Action-Adventure', 'Anime', 'Nudity', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'PvP', 'In-App Purchases', 'Memes', 'mmo', 'Sexual Content', 'MMORPG', 'Base Building', 'Online PvP', 'Masterpiece', 'retro-futurism']"

0,SoulCalibur VI,50736,"<p>Soulcalibur VI is the seventh major installment in its series of 3D sword fighting games. This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There&#39;s also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.</p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.</p>","['Action', 'Fighting']","['BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America', 'Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'NAMCO']","['Bandai Namco Entertainment', 'BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US']",2018-10-19,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",2,83,0,3.77,4,151,0,151,662,100,748542,soulcalibur-vi,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Steam Cloud', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Fantasy', 'Split Screen', 'Online multiplayer', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Character Customization', ""Beat 'em up""]"

0,My Memory of Us,47396,"<p>Do you like stories? If so, then I’ll tell you one. But it won’t be just any old story. It’s going to be different, because it’s about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let’s go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other’s company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That’s the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.</p>
<p>What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities – she can run fast, he can sneak – but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there’s nothing in the world that can stop you.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>•A moving story about friendship and love in dangerous times</p>
<p>•Beautiful, sketch-like graphics inspired by naïve art</p>
<p>•Pair mechanics: take control of two characters with different skills and abilities, or control them as a pair</p>
<p>•A grotesque tale mixed with bittersweet humor</p>
<p>•The events shown in the game are based on actual stories from war</p>
<p>•A dialogue system built around the language of symbolic pictures</p>
<p>•Various logical puzzles in 2.5D</p>

0,ARK: Survival Evolved,9810,"<p>As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br />
Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br />
You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br />
By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br />
Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br />
By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br />
Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br />
All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br />
Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br />
The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br />
On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br />
You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!<br />
The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

0,DiRT 4,21,"<p>Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’.<br />
DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.<br />
With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3.<br />
Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents.<br />

The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />
Development began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />
Resident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>

<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />
Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />
The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />
The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />
Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>
<h1>Plot</h1>
<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />
While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />
After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />
Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure']","['Capcom', 'Capcom U.S.A', 'Capcom Production Studio 4']","['Ubisoft Entertainment', 'Capcom', 'Nintendo', 'THQ', 'Nintendo Australia', 'Red Ant Enterprises']",2005-01-11,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Android', 'Nintendo']",5,83,22,4.39,5,1176,0,1184,481,0,1000000,resident-evil-4,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Sci-fi', 'Third Person', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Difficult', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Third-Person Shooter', 'Zombies', 'Captions available', 'Replay Value', 'Survival Horror', 'Remake', 'Quick-Time Events', 'Inventory Management', 'first person shooter', 'tank controls', 'survival-horror-game']"

Upon arrival, they find out that Kijuju is infected by Las Plagas, parasites that turn its carriers into zombie-like creatures.   <br />
The game is notable for being a departure from the series survival horror roots towards more action-oriented gameplay style.

Both Ellie (who is by 19 now) and Joel survived and live in Jackson, Wyoming, where Ellie is dating another girl, Dina. However, the characters have to deal with the evil cult called the Seraphites, who try to sacrifice their former members. A matter of revenge forces Ellie and her friends to undertake a trip to Seattle, Washington, to kill their enemies. The major theme of the plot is Ellie&#39;s dealing with her hate issues.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Unlike in the original game, the player controls Ellie instead of Joel, who now becomes her AI-controlled companion. The game features improved controls that include new options such as crawling, dodging, and a jump button. A new AI system allows the human adversaries to communicate share information with each other.

Become the real thief. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipement and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers and avoid too much attention from the police. Do anything that a real thief does!<br />
A good thief always observes his target. What&#39;s inside? Who lives there? What&#39;s your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Check if their dog chooses dog snacks over the bone. Dress as a courier or a cop to investigate your target even better. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it&#39;s neighbourhood.<br />
The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don&#39;t exist. When it&#39;s about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you&#39;ll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you&#39;re not shure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!<br />
A real, experienced thief can spot places where there&#39;s most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the scanner to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be. Remember that you can use it only few times during burglary and that it has a limited range.<br />
Get rid of stuff that can lead cops on your track. Turn off the GPS trackers, disconnect all the devices from the internet and erase serial numbers. Disassemblement of an car is expensive, but if it&#39;s a rare model, spending a few dollars may save you a few years in prison. Some of the goods you can sell without investing money in getting rid of tracks, but ultimately the decision is yours. Remember, that if you dont remain careful, cops will eventually knock on your door.<br />
Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Keys, notes with passwords to the alarm systems, or even fridge magnets. All those things can look useless, but can also make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren&#39;t?<br />
Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, your memory portrait will be on every pole in the city. This will seriously impact your intel possibilities and reduce the trading capabilities.<br />
Design your own house. Build a fortress and put it to the test with the Thief Simulator editor. Choose from alarm systems and security devices you&#39;ve already seen to make potential thief&#39;s life a little harder. Get yourself a dog or two. Surround your house with the electrical fence. It all depends on your imagination and wallet of course. See if others can rob you!<br />
Find your neighbour&#39;s house or build it yourself, and find out if it&#39;s easy to rob. Make a bet with frend about who robs the other one first, or join forces, build an unconquerable fortress and put it to the test by sharing it with other players.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Simulation', 'Indie']","['Noble Muffins', 'GrabTheWallet Studio']","['Forever Entertainment', 'PlayWay', 'Stolen Dreams']",2018-11-08,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",2,Without info,0,3.38,4,47,137,48,189,103,441441,thief-simulator,['Singleplayer']

Strategically recruit your goons and build a strong chemistry within your crew to maximize combat damage and help secure your hold on the city. </p>
<p>Living, Breathing World: Explore the streets of vibrant 1920s Chicago and interact with a full cast of living, breathing characters each with lives of their own that inform how they react to what you do (or don’t do). Schmooze, coerce, seduce, threaten, or kill them to get your way.</p>
<p>Wield Your Influence: Make and break alliances, bribe cops, and trade on the black market to raise your faction rating and expand your crime family. But always keep your enemies close and ensure you have a mole on the inside and eyes everywhere.</p>

0,Ys: Memories of Celceta,3829,"<p>World-famous red-haired adventurer Adol Christin awakens in the unfamiliar land of Celceta, remembering nothing more than his own name. Bereft of his past, Adol explores the town he happened to wander into, searching for any clues at all to his identity. Joined by a thief who claims to have spent some time at his side these past weeks, the young adventurer helps rescue doomed miners from a collapse – an act which ingratiates him to the local Romun Army general. Impressed with their skills, the pair is enlisted to explore the Great Forest of Celceta and map its vast expanses – a task which many have attempted in the past, but from which none have ever returned alive.<br />
Eager to unravel the mystery of his past and the cause of his predicament, Adol sets off with his new-old thief friend, Duren, to chart the untamed wilderness that claimed his memories. Along the way he meets numerous other individuals who seem to have encountered him before, and must carefully determine who among them can be trusted.<br />
Developer Nihon Falcom originally revisited the land and characters of Japanese cult favorite Ys IV in 2012 with Ys: Memories of Celceta on the PlayStation Vita, and the game found its way to North America the following year. Now, this re-envisioning moves from the small screen to PC monitors, with a bevy of updates and enhancements to fully take advantage of its new platform.<br />
Featuring a unique take on the party-based combat system that’s come to define modern Ys titles, as well as one of the largest and most varied overworlds in the series’ long and illustrious history, Ys: Memories of Celceta brings a greater sense of adventure to the Ys universe than ever before, with this PC iteration serving as the definitive version of one of the franchise’s most pivotal entries.Key FeaturesFully Enjoy the Land of Celceta with a Host of PC Enhancements<br />
This remaster comes with a wide range of HD resolutions, fixed framerates up to 120 fps with the option to unlock the framerate altogether, fully customizable control bindings, fully integrated mouse support, and more!<br />
Explore One of the Most Expansive Locales in the Series’ History<br />
The overworld of Celceta metes out battle and exploration in equal measure, accompanied by a robust mapping system with customizable waypoints and clear, detailed icons that aid the journey of Adol and company through this mysterious new land where enigmas and obstacles wait around every bend.<br />
Experience a Crucial Cornerstone of Ys Lore<br />
The events that occur over the course of Ys: Memories of Celceta’s lengthy campaign serve as some of the most important and far-reaching in the franchise, yet remain entirely self-contained so even series newcomers can fully enjoy the story.<br />
Throw Down the Gauntlet in Time Attack and Boss Rush Modes<br />
Fan-favorite Time Attack mode returns, complete with its ultimate Boss Rush challenge, pitting Adol alone against implacable foes or allowing for full-on party combat to keep the battle going well after the main story has been completed. Steam leaderboards have been implemented as well, accessible and viewable even in-game to see how you stack up against other Celcetan boss-slayers around the world!</p>","['Action', 'RPG']","['XSEED JKS', 'Nihon Falcom']","['XSEED Games', 'Marvelous USA']",2012-09-27,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",5,Without info,7,3.85,4,47,0,47,431,101,85140,ys-memories-of-celceta,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Action RPG', 'Anime', 'role-playing', 'JRPG']"

0,Indivisible,29233,"<p>Indivisible is an exciting RPG platformer set in an immersive, vibrant world that tells the story of Ajna, a good-natured tomboy with a rebellious streak. Raised by her father on the outskirts of their rural town, her life is thrown into chaos when her home is attacked and a mysterious power awakens within her. Her world now in chaos, Ajna sets out on a quest to save everything she knows from being destroyed.<br />
Key Features:<br />
Masterfully crafted story and characters: Indivisible tells the story of Ajna, and her quest to find redemption for her father and village. Throughout her quest, she’ll encounter an incredibly diverse cast of “Incarnations”, people whom she can absorb into herself and manifest to fight alongside her. There are many Incarnations to recruit, and by uniting unique characters from faraway lands, she will learn about herself and the world she inhabits.<br />
Action-packed battles: Obtain a variety of weapon types, learn new combat skills and recruit more than 25 playable Incarnations to build your battle party and engage monsters in fast-paced, strategic combat.<br />
Beautifully drawn characters and world: Building on its winning formula of 2D, hand-drawn animation with Skullgirls, LabZero draws inspiration from various cultures and mythologies to create visually dynamic environments and a rich cast of characters with unique stories of their own.<br />
Unique Battle System: The key to success is mastering your party’s attacks to create combos, and experimenting with new Incarnations and attacks to make the most out of every round. The active controls allow your party to function as a single, customizable fighting game character while switching between characters and unlocking new attacks as Ajna’s affinity for her weapons develops.<br />
Build your Inner Realm: Along with her ability to absorb certain people, Ajna will also discover she can meditate and enter a mysterious dimension growing inside her. Once she discovers it, Ajna’s Inner Realm becomes the central hub for the game, where most of the game’s quests, upgrade and saving functionality resides. Simply pressing a button will send Ajna to this realm, sparing needless trekking back to towns.<br />

0,DOOM 3,19458,"<p>DOOM 3 is a first-person shooter, the third installment in the series, serving as a reboot to the previous games. </p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>As the game is set in a science fiction universe, the events span accordingly. The year is 2145, and the technological progress has allowed humanity to set up different facilities on Mars. After an experiment goes wrong, the research center becomes inhabited by demons. The player controls a nameless space marine, fighting off hordes of enemies through a variety of levels. </p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The playable character employs a large arsenal of weaponry for his cause, from common firearms to the series’s trademark BFG9000. Each level of the game is linear, as the player must often either retrieve information, some device or reach the checkpoint. However, there are numerous obstacles on the way to the objective: the protagonist has to fight off not only demons and their servants, but also combat the natural enemy in the form of darkness. </p>
<h3>Graphics and music</h3>
<p>The engine of the game incorporates lighting and shadowing, making every object in the game feel real and natural. The textures are designed to be unappealing, as a psychological tool to ensure the player’s urge to get rid of the enemies and escape the dark and ruined corridors, but at the same time, the level of detail in each location and each enemy is very high.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']",['id Software'],"['Bethesda Softworks', 'Aspyr', 'id Software']",2004-08-03,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Nintendo']",2,87,6,3.96,4,393,0,396,551,100,1000000,doom-3,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'Moddable', 'Zombies', 'Dark', 'Survival Horror', 'Futuristic', 'Demons', 'Mars']"

Is it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!Dive into one-of-a-kind -story driven experience.Welcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton, The Longest Journey) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John, Duke Nukem), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn’t spiral out of control.<br />
Take charge of the Sheriff’s department.Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you&#39;ll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much alcohol? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You’ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.<br />

0,Dead Cells,11726,"<p>Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Not much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner&#39;s body, and gets back to the game&#39;s starting area. </p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game&#39;s heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.</p>
<p>Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.</p>
<p>The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. </p>
<p>The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can&#39;t take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.</p>","['Action', 'RPG', 'Indie', 'Platformer']","['Plug In Digital', 'Playdigious', 'Motion Twin']","['Plug In Digital', 'Playdigious', 'Motion Twin']",2018-08-07,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Nintendo']",9,88,0,4.26,4,1049,6737,1064,421,101,344021,dead-cells,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', '2D', 'Difficult', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Hack and Slash', 'Early Access', 'Replay Value', 'Side Scroller', 'Roguelike', 'Metroidvania', 'Roguelite', 'Procedural Generation', 'Perma Death']"

Once again, the player controls Rufus, a selfish yet loveable rogue, who tries to leave his home planet Deponia and move to the luxurious space station Elysium. His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you.<br />
Chaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters. Like in most adventure games, the protagonist has to use various items to solve puzzles. Those are quite complex right from the start, and there’s no growing difficulty over the course of Chaos on Deponia.</p>","['Adventure', 'RPG', 'Indie']",['Daedalic Entertainment'],['Daedalic Entertainment'],2012-10-12,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux']",5,78,3,4.1,4,223,0,223,494,80,108127,chaos-on-deponia,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Sci-fi', '2D', 'Funny', 'Comedy', 'Point & Click', 'Dystopian', 'achievements', 'Dark Humor', 'Hand-drawn']"

It is the first game in the series to feature MMO-kind of gameplay, where every players&#39; action affects the plot of the games universe. This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it&#39;s the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.<br />
Elite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. <br />

0,Friday the 13th: The Game,9891,"<p>Gameplay<br />
Friday the 13th: The Game is a third-person horror, survival game where players take on the role of a teen counselor, or for the first time ever, Jason Voorhees. You and six other unlucky souls will do everything possible to escape and survive while the most well-known killer in the world tracks you down and brutally slaughters you.  Friday the 13th: The Game will strive to give every single player the tools to survive, escape or even try to take down the man who cannot be killed. Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals!<br />
Meanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine. Take control of the legendary killer that is Jason Voorhees and terrify those unfortunate enough to cross your path!<br />
Play as Jason Voorhees!<br />
For the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You’ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!<br />
Jason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!<br />
Fans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including:<br />
Friday the 13th, Part II<br />
Friday the 13th, Part III<br />
Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives<br />
Friday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood<br />
Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan<br />
Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday<br />
How Will You Survive?<br />
The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.<br />
Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!<br />
Play as the Counselors!<br />
We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!<br />
Camp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!<br />
Mirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey.<br />
Players will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!<br />
Your Crystal Lake Database<br />
Friday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you&#39;ll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you&#39;ll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols!<br />

0,Ys Origin,249,"<p>700 years before the events of Ys I &amp; II, the land of Ys was on the brink of destruction. Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.<br />
One day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there&#39;s only one place they could have gone: the Devil&#39;s Tower.<br />
A search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact.<br />
This is their story. Or at least, it&#39;s how each of them remembers it.<br />
Expanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon.<br />
Come see how long you can last in the Devil&#39;s Tower...Key Features:Officially available in English for the very first time.<br />
Three unique playable characters in story mode, with additional variations (and characters?) unlockable through other modes.<br />
Five difficulty levels ranging from &quot;Very Easy&quot; for casual players to &quot;Nightmare&quot; for true Ys masters.<br />
Unlockable &quot;Time Attack&quot; and &quot;Boss Rush&quot; modes for anyone looking to show off his/her boss-taming abilities.<br />
Unlockable Arena Mode pits players against massive hordes of enemies for unique gameplay rewards.<br />

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player takes a role of the famous dungeon explorer set to go as far as he can in his explorations. The protagonist — his name always varies depending on the skills and background chosen — examines the 2D levels consisting of destructible and indestructible blocks filled with enemies.<br />
There is a variety of spells, weaponry, and foes usual to RPGs. Every once in a while a player encounters a boss. All the progress except for the skill points is lost after death. Between the respawns the protagonist can upgrade the level of his successors using the goods he found on his previous dungeon run.<br />
The title feature split-screen cooperative and online multiplayer for a maximum of 4 characters. The game is highly replayable due to the procedurally generated of the environment. The game suggests only going down into the dungeon thus the name. The skills may bring variety into descending every time.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>

The two form an unlikely symbiosis. The boy needs the creature’s strength and ability to fly to overcome obstacles and fend off guards who try to bring the characters back to their cells. Trico, in turn, needs the boy’s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds.

0,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,1225,"<p>This multiplayer-only game based on the popular Warhammer Fantasy franchise is set in the End Time era of this setting. The plot is centered around the city of Ubersreik that was recently taken over by a horde of rat-like monsters called Skavens. The players, who can team up in groups of up to four, are tasked with cleaning the streets from the dirty invaders. There are thirteen levels with different objectives, some of which involve collecting certain items or protecting a city well from being poisoned.<br />
The gameplay is strongly reminiscent of that in Left 4 Dead series, in which the protagonists have to slaughter monsters coming in large numbers, using both melee and ranged weapons.

0,Virginia,1257,"<p>Virginia is a silent game that offers the player to become an FBI detective and solve a mystery. It was inspired by supernatural thrillers like Twin Peaks and X-Files.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don&#39;t trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Virginia&#39;s gameplay is similar to interactive movies and &quot;walking simulators.&quot; The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what&#39;s going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it.</p>

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The main protagonist is Beck, a battle android from the Mighty Numbers series (his number is 9). A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him. Gathering Xel from Mighty Numbers, Beck receives new special abilities.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>

However, seven of the sprightliest senior citizens have other ideas and set out to prove that life for Grim in Sunny Pines definitely won't be like shooting fish in a barrel.<br/>
<br/>
The stately seven decide to strike a deal with the Grim Reaper; a mobility scooter racing championship to the death. If they can prove themselves to be fast and full of life, surviving and ultimately winning the championship, then he will allow them to live. However, too slow and they will be condemned to the retirement village in the sky. <br/>
<br/>
What the Reaper doesn’t tell the folk of Sunny Pines is that once he takes your soul he can bring you back as one of his army of the living dead; mobility scooter racing zombies that are hell bent on making sure that nobody wins, by any means possible.","['Action', 'Racing', 'Casual', 'Indie']","['Wales Interactive', 'Milky Tea Studios', 'Milky Tea']","['Wales Interactive', 'Milky Tea Studios']",2015-07-08,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",3,Without info,0,2.33,3,24,0,24,359,26,25405,coffin-dodgers,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Funny', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Split Screen', 'stats', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', '4 Player Local']"

0,Hatoful Boyfriend,3253,"<p>In Hatoful Boyfriend: A School of Hope and White Wings, the player enters the world of sentient birds to romance with them.</p>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>The game is set in a weird post-apocalyptic future, where the human civilization was taken over by the birds. In a twist similar to Planet of the Apes film series, a pandemic killed most of the humans and transformed birds into sentient beings. They established a new civilization on the ruins of their human predecessors. The few remaining humans survive in the wilderness as hunters and gatherers.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The player assumes the role of a teenage human girl. She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game&#39;s world and plot.</p>
<h3>Endings</h3>
<p>The game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans.</p>","['Adventure', 'Simulation']","['Devolver Digital', 'Mediatonic', 'The Irregular', 'Hato Moa']","['Devolver Digital', 'GHI Media']",2014-09-03,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'iOS', 'Android', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux']",3,68,0,3.25,4,157,0,159,306,100,89360,hatoful-boyfriend,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', 'Funny', 'Female Protagonist', 'Comedy', 'Zombies', 'Anime', 'Mystery', 'Memes', 'Multiple Endings', 'Visual Novel', 'Illuminati', 'Romance', 'Dating Sim', 'Parody', 'Otome']"

<p>You play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.</p>
<p>It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player&#39;s stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. </p>
<p>In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they&#39;re moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.</p>

0,Ultratron,3340,"<p>Ultratron is a 2D top-down twin-stick shooter set in the fictional universe and inspired by Robotron: 2084 — an arcade video game about robots.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls a robot and explores the locations as he pleases — there is no forcing to go further or backward. Traditionally, the left stick accounts for aiming and the right sticks sets the direction of fire. Not only the robot can utilize the firearms, but the explosives alongside with other throwables are available. The customization takes place between the levels — upgrades may be found on the battlefield and present themselves as score points which may develop one of the robot&#39;s characteristics: shields, smart bombs, droid power or so.<br />
There are forty levels in total, with every fifth being the assault one — the foes are more aggressive and unwelcoming there, and every tenth is a boss level. The goal of every level is to eliminate all the enemies and get to the end of the location. The title sometimes features the bullet hell elements — there are so many enemies on-screen, they start forming a distinct pattern recognizable as a picture.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>

Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. Infinity Runner centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a sci-fi action running game for PC, Mac, and Linux that features 14 action packed levels, Oculus Rift DK1 &amp; DK2 (Runtime 4.4) support and online multi-player.<br/>
<br/>
In Infinity Runner, the player controls the protagonist, the prisoner, from a first-person perspective as he is challenged to escape from the gargantuan spaceship. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts, the game-play conveys the players strain and physical contact with the environment whilst dealing with the constantly changing and expansive surroundings. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.  The game supports the latest virtual reality technology as well as having multi-player mode which enables up to 32 people to play head to head. <br/>
<br/>
Even though it’s a slick action game the story is very important part of your journey, as well as being your call to action it will reveal revelations along your action packed ride. Some of the story is told at high pace but there are some slower paced transition sections at the end of each level where we develop the narrative for the player. Without giving too much away you have someone guiding you through the game who talks to you telepathically. Their role is not only to orientate you but to help unfold the story for the player as you find out who you are and why you’re on the ship.<br/>
<br/>
The Oculus Rift mode literally transports you inside the Infinity spaceship to be totally immersed in the thick of the action. The game-play is designed to complement the VR mode so you get the best experience possible and it enhances the game by adding another dimension to the playing experience. <br/>
<br/>
There is also another feature that transforms the game into a unique experience, the multi-player mode. This allows up to a 32 players to battle it out head to head to find out who’s the ultimate Infinity Runner.<br/>

STARSHIP INFINITY SPECIFICATION<br/>
Over 150 miles long and nearly 30 miles in diameter at its widest point, the progress of The Infinity's construction at the Tranquillity Ship yards on the Moon could clearly be seen from Earth. The revolutionary ship requires a crew of 5,000,000 people to keep it running and is designed to house another 10 million people as general population ready for the colonisation of new worlds. The Bio-domes, seen along the side of the ship, house forests that cover nearly 60,000 square miles in total, providing oxygen and a food source for the population and an environment for rest and relaxation. The greatest technological achievement can be found in the engine room, which houses the revolutionary Infinity Drive. It is vastly smaller than previous engines at a mere 10 miles long and far more powerful than traditional models which would take up to a third of the length of a starship, creating space for more brave colonists heading out into the unknown.","['Action', 'Indie']",['Wales Interactive'],['Wales Interactive'],2014-07-14,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",4,56,0,3.0,3,7,0,7,405,14,153283,infinity-runner,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Full controller support', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Space', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Parkour', 'VR', 'Runner', 'Werewolves']"

Gameplay in Stealth Inc. 2 is centered around stealth action, for which the game was even compared to the Splinter Cell series despite huge stylistic differences. The clone has to move swiftly and silently to avoid security cameras and sentry robots. Its time is limited, however, and the player has to find the balance between speed and safety. Level design in Stealth Inc. 2 reminds of Metroidvania-style platformers. The factory is split into areas, consisting of eight test chambers each, all of them interconnected in the manner called overworld. The player will have to solve puzzles to open new areas.

All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. <br />

0,Hellpoint,22123,"<p>Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.<br />
You play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.<br />
In the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.<br />
Hellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.<br />
In Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.<br />
Irid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.<br />
Hellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we&#39;ve had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.<br />
For centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?<br />
Hellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.<br />
The more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.<br />
A terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...<br />
Every time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG', 'Indie']",['Cradle Games'],"['tinyBuild', 'Cradle Games']",2020-07-30,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",1,60,0,3.23,3,12,0,13,490,0,0,hellpoint,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Split Screen', 'Local Co-Op', 'Violent', 'stats', 'Local Multiplayer', 'role-playing']"

The plot of the game moves forward with the actions of the main character - Rufus, who lives on the planet of Deponia, long ago turned into a dump. Rufus dreams of moving to Elysium - a planet where life is entirely different.<br />
He calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation &quot;Organnon&quot;, to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots. The girl herself lost her memory of the fall, and the members of the Organnon have an intention to blow up Deponia.</p>","['Adventure', 'RPG', 'Indie', 'Puzzle']",['Daedalic Entertainment'],['Daedalic Entertainment'],2012-01-27,Teen,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'iOS', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Linux', 'Nintendo']",4,74,3,3.84,4,505,0,506,588,101,312421,deponia,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', 'Sci-fi', '2D', 'Funny', 'Difficult', 'Comedy', 'Point & Click', 'Dystopian', 'Steampunk', 'achievements', 'Dark Humor', 'Hand-drawn', 'Hidden Object']"
