Multiplayer side of things in the Call of Duty series has been more popular among the players. A lot of features, not present in the single-player campaign, will be available to the player, such as a killstreak mechanic, that rewards players for killing multiple enemies without dying. Multiplayer maps consist of team-based and deathmatch based game modes, where players take on the objectives in order to complete the map mission or to obtain the largest amount of kills. Depending on how well the player does, they will be rewarded with experience points, which will allow them to level up and unlock new weapons, abilities, and perks for the playable classes.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']","['Raven Software', 'Treyarch', 'Infinity Ward', 'n-Space']","['Square Enix', 'Activision Blizzard', 'Aspyr', 'Activison', 'Active']",2007-11-05,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Apple Macintosh', 'Nintendo']",6,92,24,4.4,5,1100,0,1108,601,101,1000000,modern-warfare,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'Story Rich', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Classic', 'Controller', 'Moddable', 'Zombies', 'War', 'PvP', 'Competitive', 'Military', 'Linear', 'Modern', 'campaign', ' first-person shooter']",Call of Duty : Modern Warfare

35,Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden,58921,"<p>In Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, the player controls a trio of weird mutant warriors. It is based on a 1984 board game Mutants.</p>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which a nuclear war annihilated all humanity. Many years later, Earth is inhabited by the mutated creatures that look like combinations of humans with other animals and things. There&#39;s The Ark, a neon-lit sinkhole that serves as the hub for the player characters. This is where they can buy ammunition and armor, meet other characters and accept quests. Then there&#39;s the Zone, a largely unexplored dangerous world where Mutants roam. Somewhere in the Zone lies the legendary Eden, a safe haven where they can find all the answers they seek.</p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>The game has three main protagonists. First, there&#39;s Dux, the duck-headed wise-cracking mutant with an attitude. Then there&#39;s Bormin, a huge gruff pig that has anger issues. Their third companion is Selma, a seemingly human female who has protective stone skin. Each of the characters specializes in using certain weapons and has a set of special mutant abilities.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden combines real-time exploration and stealth system with square grid-bound tactical turn-based combat in the vein of X-Com series.

44,ACE COMBAT 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,59352,"<p>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is the eighth major installment of the Ace Combat series of flight simulators.</p>
<h3>Premise and setting</h3>
<p>The series is set in the Strangereal, a fictional alternate version of Earth. This world has different geography and history, albeit its countries and cultures are based on prototypes from our real world. Skies Unknown follows the Lighthouse War (also called the Second Continental War) a conflict between the Kingdom of Erusea and the Osean Federation in an alternate 2019. The goal of the war is to control the International Space Elevator. The Erusean army attacks the Osean military that protected the Elevator. In response, Osea launches a large-scale attack against Farbanti, Erusea&#39;s capital city, causing massive loss of civilian lives.</p>
<h3>Main characters</h3>
<p>The main protagonist in the Skies Unknown story campaign is Trigger, a pilot in the Osean Air Force. He was framed for murder and transferred to the penal squadron. While the player starts as an Osean military, the game does not favor any side in the conflict. Rosa Cossette D&#39;Elise, a princess and heir to the throne of Erusea, also plays a major role in the plot.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls Trigger&#39;s fighter plane, F-22A Raptor, and completes various missions against enemy fighter jets. Other types of aircraft do not appear in this game, unlike in the previous games.

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>As with all Hitman series, the game follows Agent 47, a hitman for hire and a member of a secret assassins&#39; organization called International Contract Agency. His missions are tied together by a story that continues the plot of 2016&#39;s Hitman. The protagonist is searching for an anonymous opponent known as Shadow Client, who was also the main antagonist of the previous game. Hitman 2 also provides insight into Agent 47&#39;s mysterious past. The hunt for Shadow Client and his militia takes Agent 47 to new locations, such as a motor race on the sunny streets of Miami and a deadly tropical rainforest in Colombia.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>As usual for Hitman series, the player controls Agent 47 from the third person view (switching to the first person when using sniper rifles) in a 3D environment. The game consists of several missions in which the protagonist has to assassinate various targets around the world using non-conventional tactics, stealth, and camouflage. Hitman 2 features an advanced crowd AI and an improved stealth system that allows the player to hide between the trees and in the crowd. The game also features new weapons, such as concussion gadgets that the player can use to knock people out.</p>

78,ARK: Survival Evolved,9810,"<p>As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br />
Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br />
You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br />
By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br />
Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br />
By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br />
Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br />
All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you&#39;ll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br />
Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br />
The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br />
On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK&#39;s by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique &#39;Procedurally Generated ARKs&#39;, for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br />
You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!<br />
The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

83,Sine Mora EX,27944,"<p>Sine Mora is a Latin expression meaning “without delay.” The setting of this shoot &#39;em up game is described as “style-inspired dieselpunk.”</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>There are two plots in the game, developing at different points in time.</p>
<p>The first story is about a father who avenges the Empire for his son. His son, a bomber pilot, was executed by the Empire because he refused to drop a nuclear bomb during the Enkies attack.</p>
<p>The second story is about the last survivors of the Enkie race, who also plan to take revenge on the Empire for the fact that the Empire destroyed them.</p>
<p>Both plots of the game often develop in the same locations, but the differences between the situation in these places are very significant, because the events of different plots occur at completely different times.</p>
<p>Everything happens on the planet Seol, which is very hike to Earth. However, the crust of this planet is very unstable, and this is the cause of the constant earthquakes. The landscape of the planet is very variable, its geography changes significantly over very short periods of time.</p>
<p>By the time the game starts on the planet, two main factions compete: the aggressive Empire, ruled by the dictator, and the kingdom of Atarak, inhabited by the Enkie race.</p>
<p>The Enkie race follows the teachings of the great prophet Enkie and is able to manage time. They can carry themselves and any object at any time past or future.</p>
<p>The empire does not know how to manage time, but it is developing a machine that can do it. This machine will be able to accelerate the individual time of any object or living being, in order to bring it to the end of its existence, erasing, as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls the aircraft, the main weapon of which can be upgraded. The main weapon can be used without limitation. There is also a secondary weapon. It is more powerful, but its use is limited.</p>
<p>The player&#39;s performance is estimated by the sum of the indicators: the destruction of enemies, the damage received, collected powerups (shielding, extra time, and upgraded weapon).</p>
<p>Destruction of enemies with the primary weapon will increase the game&#39;s score multiplier, while use of the secondary weapon or time manipulation will reset the multiplier.</p>
<p>The game has four difficulties: normal, challenging, hard and insane.</p>
<p>Game modes are: Story, Arcade, Score Attack, and Boss Training.</p>
<p>Instead of health, a player’s state is measured by time. At the beginning of each level, the player receives a certain amount of time. This time can be reduced (accelerated) due to the actions of enemies, and the destruction of enemies, on the contrary, increases, stretches time.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']","['THQ Nordic', 'Grasshopper Manufacture', 'Digital Reality', 'Gyroscope Games']",['THQ Nordic'],2017-08-07,Without info,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",3,82,0,3.26,4,50,0,50,615,0,18148,sine-mora-ex,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'First-Person', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Local Co-Op', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Side Scroller', ""Shoot 'Em Up"", 'Bullet Hell']",Sine Mora EX

Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest.

Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens.

Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don&#39;t go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>In Umbrella Corps you take a role of mercenary working for Umbrella Co.<br />
The player can switch between first-person and third-person perspectives. The game features both multiplayer and single-player modes although the game was primarily marketed as a multiplayer title. The single-player part consists of than 24 missions most of which task you with collecting DNA samples from killed zombies.<br />
The key feature of Umbrella Corps’ multiplayer is that alongside players, the maps are filled with aggressive zombies. They attack any mercenary they see, and can be a real threat when in large numbers. The players possess “Zombie Jammer,” a device that makes zombies ignore them. However, opposite players can disrupt. The combat system in the game is cover based meaning it allows one to hide behind walls or other large objects. The multiplayer also has a progression system which allows the player to unlock new weapons and cosmetic items. There are several types of weapons in the game including pistols, rifles, explosives, shotguns and melee weapons. The most notable melee weapons are ax-like Brainer which one-shot almost any enemy with a charged attack. The multiplayer features several game modes most of which are typical for this type of game. The most notable mode is DNA hunter in which you have to collect more DNA samples from killed zombies than your opponents.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']","['Capcom', 'Capcom U.S.A']",['Capcom'],2016-06-21,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",5,Without info,22,1.77,1,61,0,62,681,0,192642,umbrella-corps,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', 'Third Person', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Online multiplayer', 'Third-Person Shooter', 'Zombies', 'Anime', 'PvP', 'Team-Based', 'Competitive', 'combat', 'online', 'unique', 'evil']",Umbrella Corps
104,DOOM,52884,"<p>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.<br />
In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as &quot;Doomguy&quot;, fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as &quot;WADs&quot;. As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre&#39;s boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game&#39;s release, became known simply as &quot;Doom clones&quot;. Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.<br />
The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game&#39;s source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast paced action of the first two games.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']","['id Software', 'Nerve Software']","['SEGA', 'Valve', 'Bethesda Softworks', 'Activision Blizzard', 'Atari', 'GT Interactive Software', 'Ocean Software', 'GT Interactive', 'WMS Industries', 'Williams Entertainment', 'Imagineer']",1993-12-10,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Linux', 'Nintendo', 'Atari', 'SEGA', '3DO']",0,Without info,6,4.38,5,511,0,515,425,0,1000000,doom-2,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Classic', 'Gore', 'vr mod', 'violance']",DOOM

Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people&#39;s consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.<br />
Her parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.<br />
The CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.<br />
The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces in different ways.

143,Battlefield V,58494,"<p>Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. </p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player&#39;s interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.<br />
The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.</p>
<h3>Modes</h3>
<p>Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter', 'Adventure', 'Massively Multiplayer']","['Electronic Arts', 'Electronic Arts DICE', 'Uprise']",['Electronic Arts'],2018-11-20,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",4,77,9,3.57,4,550,155,559,617,101,1000000,battlefield-v,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Full controller support', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Female Protagonist', 'Violent', 'Action-Adventure', 'War', 'PvP', 'Historical', 'Military', 'World War II', 'Destruction', 'combat', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Online PvP', 'LGBTQ+', 'Battle Royale', 'ww2']",Battlefield  V Edição Definitiva

149,Ys IX: Monstrum Nox,401804,"<p>Ys IX: Monstrum Nox takes place in Balduq, northeast of Esteria in the Gllia region under Romun control. Balduq is known as &#39;the prison city&#39; for its large prison facility inside the town and its architecture featuring high walls as a result of being built upon the fortified era. Furthermore the city is an important nexus for transportation in the region resulting in a wide range of inns, bars and trade centers. In more recent years public facilities such as theaters and baths are starting to be developed too.</p>
<p>In more recent years rumours of beings called &quot;Monstrum&quot; are said to have started appearing creating a huge fuss with its residents. The Monstrum are said to possess unique supernatural abilities, some of them seem to be helping the poor and helpless, others are outlaws up to no good. This dichotomy results in the villagers becoming scared/wary of them.</p>
<p>Balduq Prison, located at the edge of the city, supposedly is the largest prison facility of the Romun empire. Originally it was a fortress built to protect the Romun border, it is more recently that it has been repurposed as a prison facility. Featuring only one entrance through a drawbridge and surrounded by steep rock walls and deep moats it is said to be inescapable. The townsfolk does not hold the prison facility in high regard as the facility also is used to detain critics of the empire as does it detain political prisoners.</p>

186,Call of Cthulhu,58831,"<p>Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is a psychological horror game adapted from the 1981 tabletop role-playing game of the same name by Chaosium. It is loosely based on the famous horror story by H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos universe in general.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The game is set in 1924 in Massachusetts, USA. The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce&#39;s investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane. His mental state affects the gameplay.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG']",['Cyanide Studio'],['Focus Home Interactive'],2018-10-29,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",4,66,0,3.52,4,213,253,221,367,0,232247,call-of-cthulhu-the-official-video-game,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'First-Person', 'Horror', 'Action-Adventure', 'role-playing', 'Narration', 'Lovecraftian']",Call of Cthulhu

<p>Despite the trend made by NFS&#39; before Payback features an offline mode. The game is set in a fictional city named Fortune Valley. The player can choose between the three individuals to represent. The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player&#39;s liking. <br />
There is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner. All the modes share the goal — to reach the finish. However, the initial purpose is altered depending on the race — sometimes one has to drift his way to the finish line, somewhere the manual transmission turns one, and the gear switching comes to be mandatory.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>Payback is one of few NFS&#39; to feature ongoing narrative — the story of this one emphasizes the revenge theme. Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time.

211,Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy,4469,"<p>The game that started Jak and Daxter series is a mixture of 3D platforming and puzzles delivered in a cartoonish visual style.</p>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>Jak and Daxter’s world is a distant fantasy planet. It is dominated by the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization, the Precursors. This civilization also created eco, a type of energy that comes in different colors and can be used to various effects. There’s the dark eco that can distort life, and its Dark Sage, Gol Acheron, is going to unleash it on the world. He sent his servants, the Lurkers, to gather eco for him.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The player assumes the role of Jak, a mute yet troublemaking teenage boy. His best friend is a boy called Daxter. When the two explored the forbidden ruins, the Lurkers attacked them. Daxter came under the influence of dark eco and mutated into a mixture of otter and weasel he calls “ottsel.” He can still talk, however, and will comment on Jak’s actions throughout the game. Jak learns that only Gol Acheron can bring Daxter back to normal. The boy, accompanied by Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a dangerous journey to save his friend and the world.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Much of the gameplay is centered around collecting items and resources. On each level, Jak has to obtain power cells to activate Precursors’ machines and advance to the next area. Other collectibles, such as eco particles, improve the protagonist’s attacks, health, or speed. Jak’s attacks are mostly hand-to-hand, but yellow eco allows him to shoot bolts.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Arcade']","['Sony Interactive Entertainment', 'Naughty Dog']",['Sony Computer Entertainment'],2001-12-04,Everyone 10+,['PlayStation'],1,Without info,3,3.96,4,316,0,317,192,100,258827,jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy,"['puzzles', 'shoot', 'speed', 'ancient', 'colors']",Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy

223,The Escapists,3307,"<p>The Escapists is an indie adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements developed by Mouldy Toof Studios.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>You play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.</p>
<p>It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player&#39;s stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. </p>
<p>In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they&#39;re moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.</p>
<h3>Miscellanious</h3>

224,Overcooked,2115,"<p>Overcooked puts the player into the shoes of two restaurant chefs at once. Each level is a kitchen, and your goal is to cook a list of meals following the onscreen recipes. The time is limited, and there are restrictions on how much money the player can spend on the ingredients. The player controls two characters that can be switched at any time or ordered to do a list of actions. <br />
The kitchens are often set in the oddball places, such as a pirate ship, two speeding trucks, a pedestrian crosswalk, or an iceberg. The level elements are dynamic and may move or change during the gameplay. Tables and ovens can slide, and the cooks can fall off the level, though they will respawn shortly. <br />
There’s a story mode in which cooking is tied to the plot. The game is set in the Onion Kingdom that was attacked by an insatiable spaghetti monster. The chefs travel back in time to refine their cooking skills and feed the monster when it appears again.<br />
Since even in the single mode the player has to control two cooks, the game predictably has a co-op multiplayer and a competitive mode in which the players try to “outcook” each other.

233,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered,884,"<h3>The restart</h3>
<p>Released in 2016, the remastered version of one of the most revolutionary parts of the annual Call of Duty series. In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.</p>
<h3>Key features</h3>
<p>In the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.</p>
<h3>The changes</h3>
<p>The main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']","['Raven Software', 'Activision', 'Beenox']",['Activision Blizzard'],2016-10-05,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox']",5,86,24,3.95,4,833,0,837,318,100,1000000,call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Online Co-Op', 'Online multiplayer', 'Violent', 'War', 'Remake']",Call of Duty : Modern Warfare  Remastered

It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.</p>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<p>The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map.

<p>In Umbrella Corps you take a role of mercenary working for Umbrella Co.<br />
The player can switch between first-person and third-person perspectives. The game features both multiplayer and single-player modes although the game was primarily marketed as a multiplayer title. The single-player part consists of than 24 missions most of which task you with collecting DNA samples from killed zombies.<br />
The key feature of Umbrella Corps’ multiplayer is that alongside players, the maps are filled with aggressive zombies. They attack any mercenary they see, and can be a real threat when in large numbers. The players possess “Zombie Jammer,” a device that makes zombies ignore them. However, opposite players can disrupt. The combat system in the game is cover based meaning it allows one to hide behind walls or other large objects. The multiplayer also has a progression system which allows the player to unlock new weapons and cosmetic items. There are several types of weapons in the game including pistols, rifles, explosives, shotguns and melee weapons. The most notable melee weapons are ax-like Brainer which one-shot almost any enemy with a charged attack. The multiplayer features several game modes most of which are typical for this type of game. The most notable mode is DNA hunter in which you have to collect more DNA samples from killed zombies than your opponents.</p>","['Action', 'Shooter']","['Capcom', 'Capcom U.S.A']",['Capcom'],2016-06-21,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation']",5,Without info,22,1.77,1,61,0,62,681,0,192642,umbrella-corps,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'Steam Cloud', 'Full controller support', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', 'Third Person', 'FPS', 'Horror', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Gore', 'Survival', 'Online multiplayer', 'Third-Person Shooter', 'Zombies', 'Anime', 'PvP', 'Team-Based', 'Competitive', 'combat', 'online', 'unique', 'evil']",Umbrella Corps Deluxe Edition
284,Bloodborne,3387,"<p>Bloodborne is an action-RPG and another member of souls-like title series. The game has no predecessors or successors, making it the only entry with one add-on: “The Old Hunters.” The Bloodborne universe, however, also includes a comics and a board game.</p>
<p>Generally resembling the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, however, has some different mechanics and the pace of combat is increased thanks to the risk-rewarding battle system. Another difference is multiplayer, which comes in two kinds: you can summon other players into your game and fight bosses side by side or you can fight impostors, who are other players invading your playthrough.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, you are forced to explore an enormous open world of Yharnam, which looks like alternate universe Lovecraft-inspired Victorian-era England, as The Hunter. You meet horrific bosses, explore vast areas, houses and open spaces while continually dodging, attacking and trying not to get killed by a massive number of hostile NPCs.</p>","['Action', 'RPG']","['Sony Interactive Entertainment', 'FromSoftware']",[],2015-03-24,Mature,['PlayStation'],12,92,0,4.4,5,1852,2960,1873,573,101,1000000,bloodborne,"['Atmospheric', 'Story Rich', 'Third Person', 'Exploration', 'exclusive', 'Character Customization', 'Dark Fantasy', 'true exclusive']",Bloodborne  Complete Edition Bundle

286,Dying Light,42215,"<p>Dying Light is a first-person action horror game with the elements of survival. It is a first part of the Dying light series followed by Dying Light 2. The game is set in the open-world environment of fictional Harran city. Players are offered to assume the role of an undercover agent Kyle Crane who has been sent in the quarantine zone. His mission is to find the rogue politician Kadir &quot;Rais&quot; Suleiman lost somewhere in the infected giant city. On the way to achieving the goal, Kyle will meet other survivors, who desperately try to stay alive among zombies. The chief game mechanic is running the generators and turning on streetlights throughout Harran to make another part of the map accessible and safe at nighttime. The game features day/night time cycles that change the game remarkably: the action becomes fast-paced, and all the infected people turn into dangerous zombies. Therefore, the gameplay is based on armed combat against mutants and Kyle’s sneak and parkour skill for preventing it.</p>","['Action', 'Adventure', 'RPG']",['Techland'],['Warner Bros.

290,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,58616,"<p>Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey is the twentieth game in its series. It is the earliest game in the Assassin&#39;s Creed universe chronology and the prequel to Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>The events of Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey&#39;s take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin&#39;s Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.</p>","['Action', 'RPG']","['Ubisoft', 'Ubisoft Montreal', 'Ubisoft Shanghai', 'Ubisoft Quebec', 'Ubisoft Montpellier', 'Ubisoft Kiev', 'Ubisoft Bucharest', 'Ubisoft Singapore']",['Ubisoft Entertainment'],2018-10-05,Mature,"['PC', 'PlayStation', 'Xbox', 'Nintendo']",32,85,14,4.04,4,1316,1957,1336,644,100,707097,assassins-creed-odyssey,"['Singleplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Atmospheric', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'Third Person', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Female Protagonist', 'Stealth', 'Captions available', 'In-App Purchases', 'Historical', 'Parkour', 'Assassin']",Assassin’s Creed  Odyssey Deluxe Edition
